I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.",

Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.  Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):  (1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)  (2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US  (3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)  (4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.  Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.",

I ordered 2 lbs of the honey and received brown sugar instead. When I tried to return it for the right product (the honey) I got absolutely NO RESPONSE. None. I sent countless emails, but nothing. It is a great product with a great taste, but the company is a little dodgy, so be careful.",

I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.  My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken breasts, chick peas and sweet onions in a slow cooker.  I poured on the seasoning as I added each layer (onions, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning) to the extent that I though surely I had overdone it.  The result was tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  It's not that it wasn't flavorful enough, it was flavorless.  I confess that I grew up in a household where we ate \"world food\" all the time, we just didn't know what it was because we had no cable TV and there was no FoodTV back in the dark ages anyway.  I live in an area where authentic ethnic food is everywhere.  Maybe my taste buds are completely fried (I do like me some spicy hot anything!) but to me this has less character than a moderate sprinkling of plain old black pepper, which is no character at all.",
