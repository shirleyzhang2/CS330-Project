However if you're idea is to \"stash\" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay.  One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free. \n Summary: I wouldn't bother.",

It should have been called \"Carrots in Beef Broth\" Soup. It only had 6 pieces of meat and 5 or 6 little chunks of potato with about 20 pieces of carrots. I usually dump a handful of frozen sweet corn or peas in it and a handful of instant rice to help fill it out. But this time I was out of frozen veggies so I got to see just what ISN'T in the soup. Like there's more stuff missing than in it. Once I finish off the cans that I have left I sure ain't going to waist any more of my money on it.  I scanned and uploaded the ingredients on the label from one of the smaller microwavable cans of the same Chunky Beef Soup.
