I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

However I do not have that type of funds.  Not trying to low ball you however, can you do $18.00\nSeller: 18 is far too low. I could maybe do 32$ if you pick it up yourself.\nBuyer: Hmmm, that will eat the rest of my budget for the hunt.  However, I only got three items left, and by buying this form you I nail two!

The interior is in great condition though!\nBuyer: Oh, it doesn't say that when I look at it. Well... in that case would you take $5000 for it? I'm going to have to get it checked out by a mechanic and I'm  not sure what else I might have to do to repair it, so I think that's what I'd like to pay.\nSeller: That is far too low. The accident was a small accident and the value is still more than double your offer despite that. Can you make a reasonable offer? \nBuyer: It is a 7 year old car even without a salvage title.
