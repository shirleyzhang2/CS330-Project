I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

Let me tell you this bike is a decked out Santa Cruz Chameleon Custom. You can come take it for a ride and I guarantee you will fall in love with it.\nBuyer: I would like that, it is a bit of a drive for me. Can you tell me, has this bike ever been in an accident? Any marks or scratches?\nSeller: Never crashed it and no marks at all. It's only about 3 months old. I'm looking to sell it for $850\nBuyer: Can you tell me, are the extra set of street tires new? How much tread is on them both?\nSeller: The tires on the bike are in great condition. The extra set was only used for about a week so they are basically new.\nBuyer: How long have you owned the bike?\nSeller: 3 months.\nBuyer: Are you the first owner? I am very interested in the bike.\nSeller: I'm the only owner!\nBuyer: Okay, great! Are you willing to come down on the price some? I am serious about buying this bike. However, like I said, it is a bit of a drive for me to come and get it.\nSeller: Well, these bikes retail for $2,200 and I'm throwing in an extra set of tires. I think that the asking price of $850 is a steal. \nBuyer: That is a bit steep considering the travel it involves to come and buy it. I am serious with cash in hand.\nSeller: If you have the $850 and are ready to buy, I will bring it to your doorstep.\nBuyer: Could you do $750?\nSeller: I could but I'd have to take out the extra set of street tires.\nBuyer: How about $790 with the extra set of street tires included?\nSeller: You got yourself a deal.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

The tires are also relatively new and should have plenty of life left.\nBuyer: Can I have my mechanic take a look at it before I buy it?\nSeller: Of course\nBuyer: Can you lower the price a bit? I am on a budget.\nSeller: I'm open to an offer. What did you have in mind?\nBuyer: I would like to pay 1700 for it.\nSeller: Honestly, I could scrap it for about that.

Picks up the low and high tones and sounds great. \nBuyer: Awesome! I'm pretty good with installing stereos, if I skip the installation, is there any chance I could get a lower deal on these? Somewhere around $85 - $90?\nSeller: Are you sure pretty good instal is what you want? Because I could go $95 which would give you expert instillation along with a great set of subs. \nBuyer: $95 seems pretty reasonable, and a professional installation does sound much more reliable.
