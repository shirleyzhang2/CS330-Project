Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

The adapter is rated up to 100 amps, which means most home appliances would probably be fine, but it did not work fine with mine. When I plug these into the wall,it started off as a trickle charge, almost like plugging something in. Then even though that was happening, It wouldn't stop charging my cell, ipad, or ipod until all three items were fully recharged. Very disappointed.",

And it seems others have suffered from similar frustration. The CD is just like all other MP3 sound quality. Nothing too bad at loud volume, but if you want something that doesn't get annoying every half hour, then don't buy it. The CD has way less volume than I would like. A lot less noticeable on first listen, then almost imperceptible after it.",

I even learned about different options for eating food without meat. But sometimes it takes much more than tips to convince me to eat something. To read this book, you'll need an open mind, too.",

One story had a boy in high school trying to run away from home into adulthood by becoming an FBI agent and making millions in Hollywood. His wife got pregnant but he did not. There are many more that could have been mentioned on how his real mother never really existed or if she even existed. He lived under someone else's name for years then remarried after divorcing twice. Also, the names given in the book where different.",

I didn't expect to be thrilled or entertained, but rather a movie for my daughter about how God has given us special talents within us. She would not understand all this drivel, even if it were a movie. As many times as we watched the movie, she kept saying &quot;Daddy, what's happening?&quot; What am I? How do these things change over time? If someone can explain more on this, it will help me.",
