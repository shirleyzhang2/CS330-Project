    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two words, and you must predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. Predict the preposition that explicitly conveys both words' meaning. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the correct preposition would be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
