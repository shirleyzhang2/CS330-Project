Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

            "input": "My son received this book as a gift. I was extremely disappointed. It is an old book, and the print quality and size are unreadable. At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

There might have been some really interesting research undertaken in trying to establish a list of the top 100 movies ever made and their critical success or failure, however, this kind of writing about movie review is very dry. It lacks focus throughout and could certainly use tighter editing. While I suppose if you are writing historical analysis, it makes sense, but for most readers, there were parts here that seemed so unfocused as they ran on.",

It was almost over before it started but it kept us engaged enough to want more of the story. The author put some good thought into her world building in this book. When you read the description of the books it sounds great but when going the download its quite amazing how they all come together perfectly. I can't wait to see what's next. Good job Anita.",

Not really helpful to me. Good if you need help with your puppy or cat, though. Also, no advice for owners who own older pets, like my dog.",

And my favorite baked bean recipe turns out even more delicious using this pan. I put some water in each cup just before adding baking soda, which eliminates clumping, and then add my batter. It bakes up perfectly all around - no big globs of liquid left over. The pan heats evenly also, without getting hot spots anywhere.",

I even put it on the same day they told me that it would, and when we checked our window with the sun coming in to see if there were any fleas on, one of them had already jumped out. DO NOT BUY THIS! It didn't work. We bought another product. This time from pet store too. That really worked though. Don't waste your money here. : /Oh ya, it did arrive quick. But it wasn't worth it.",
