    "Definition": [
        "You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question from the five possible categories: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions typically contain letter variables and ask you to find the value of a variable. (2) 'arithmetic' questions ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root, or value of expressions involving brackets. (3) 'measurement' questions are about converting a quantity from some unit to some other unit. (4) 'numbers' questions are about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc. (5) 'probability' questions ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category."
