    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two words and you have to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition you predict should be one that explicitly conveys the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", a possible preposition would be \"king of fort\". The possible prepositions you can choose from are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
