The label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative.

After nearly 10 months in Iraq, being able to shake pepper out of this thing and smell it in the air is heaven compared to the tiny little pepper packets they give us that have little to no taste.  I really do love the smell of this pepper and it tastes great.  You may be better off buying it in the grocery store and not paying for shipping if you can manage that, though =) \n Summary: Smells Great",

Before I started him on this food he had problems with skin allergies and being picky about food. Although the price for this food is a little daunting it is worth the price! You feed about half the amount you normally would since its so nutrient dense so one bag lasts us almost a month where a bag of purina would last us about 2 weeks. His skin allergies also cleared up in about month and his coat has never looked better and the dandruff is gone too. The only down side is when you first switch over it can cause some loose stools-but it gets better once their digestive system gets adjusted. All in all if you can afford to feed them EVO its well worth the investment! \n Summary: Best food for your best friend",

On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else.

Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad. \n Summary: the best chocolate taste out there!",

The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq. \n Summary: delicious",
