            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

The tragedy began when my mom who drank the bubble tea an hour before me complained about stomach pain and having to visit the washroom several times. I was skeptical when she first told me and dismissed it as just her having a sensitive stomach. However after a few minutes I realized I should take some precautions as I did not want to risk it. At that point I had only drank less than half of what was in my cup. Fifteen minutes or so passes by when I felt my stomach churning and at that moment I realized it wasnt just my old ladys sensitive stomach that was the problem: it was this cup of laxativ- I mean bubble tea. Thank goodness I stopped drinking it before WWIII happened in my bathroom. Not to mention, my Mom who rarely treats herself to take out/drinks ended up suffering due to your 'bubble tea'. On the bright side, if I ever have constipation problems, I can now purchase a cup-o-laxatives from your store instead of having to spend $14.99 from London Drugs. Talk about value for your money !",

            "input": "Lucky Plus is a Hong Kong-style cafe restaurant.  I think they recently opened as there were still many bouquet signs in front when I visited with my family.  The menu seems to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot.  The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor, with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded.  But that's where the good side ends.  Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down (at 11am just when they opened).  She came to our table 3 times in a short span of 5 minutes.  We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes (Hand shredded chicken and 7-flavor deep fried squid) and a couple of entree dishes (Fried noodles with chicken, Mapo tofu rice, Sauteed shrimp).  It took almost 35 minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch.  When the food dishes showed up at last, we were very disappointed at every dish.  The hand shredded chicken was more of cut-up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in.  The 7-flavour deep-fried squid tasted bland -- I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour.  The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special (including taste!).  The sauteed shrimps were not well de-veined so tasted bitter.  We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice?  Well, the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up, but the rice was too hard (tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight).  Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus!  To add to the poor service and bad quality food, we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten 3 times over!  If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer!  But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes.  We hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers.  But they will need to do this quickly as many traditional Chinese clients like myself would not likely go back after the one bad experience.",

I first tried NF in a yurt in CA; I loved it then & I love it now. I avoid highly processed foods now, and my favorites there tend to be the fake meat items (highly processed) and the cupcakes (so good- but the frosting is highly processed) but I still like eating here every so often. They really do vegan right. Its really all about the sauces & seasonings. Im ok in the kitchen, but Id love to be able to make flavors like they do. I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, 'I coulda made that better at home.' But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do! Kudos Native Foods for being dedicated to your cause AND truly delicious... Not just for vegans!",

It doesnt matter what time of day you go here on a Saturday - whether its raining or snowing, be prepared to wait.  This time we had Mario who regrettably forgot about us. We sat in by the window so it was cool, we had the chance to people-watch as we chatted a bit about the current news. Ive been here countless times.  A time when we got the new guy who had no idea what he was doing but we were patient. Another time when the manager came over to tease my bf about a Falcons hat he was wearing.  Another time when the manager didnt even remember who he was. That was funny. Another time when we had to approach the manager about an issue. But THIS time was something different.  Anyway what brought me to write this review was because of the celebrity spotting - AmberRose...not to be confused with Yeezys ex Amber Rose, not Whiz Khalifas babys momma Amber Rose, not the Amber Rose that refers to her Twitter followers as RoseBuds but Amber Rosario - or something like that. I heard the voice of a sweet southern girl who introduced herself to her table - 'Hi, Im AmberRose and I will be your server today...' All I could see in front of me was my bf laughing, then he covered his face. I turn to my left 'OH, OK!' and quickly turned my head before she could see that I was chuckled a bit. It was funny and cute at the same time. She was so sweet. I honestly wished that she was serving us because she wouldve given us the hookup on some extras if you know what I mean. Even if you dont, you have to go see for yourself.Besides that Mario was cool. I usually get upset when Im ignored by my waiter but I didnt even see him walking around. I had so much fun that morning that it didnt even phase me.The food is always cooked to perfection and it comes out quickly. I always get exactly what I order. Im really picky about my eggs. I prefer shelled eggs - or country style eggs as they like to call them. I dont care if theyre country or city. I want them out of a shell. The pancakes are always good. Although they slip on the hot syrup sometimes, all you had to do is ask and theyll bring it right to you.  The price is reasonable. You may catch a special every now and then. Other than that the staff is great and the atmosphere is homely. Try this iHop but remember, do not come extremely hungry. Theres always a wait.",

So with that said, we were pleasantly surprise by the thin-crust hand-tossed customizable options available at Hearth Pizza Tavern. Mind you, we passed this place a dozen times and subliminally misread the signage as 'health' and so totally blanked it out Lol. Until one day some friends suggested me meet there for dinner so when we look again the 'r' miraculously appeared. Even the exterior of the restaurant doesnt strike you as a gourmet pizza restaurant and bar but it is. The exterior can definitely pass for a health food store or even a health spa. We ordered four of the signature pizzas: Simple White, The Cure, Chicken Coup Deville and the I-95. These were all superb and 50% off on Mondays! I also tried their lamb sliders but as a lamb snob I much rather stick with traditional Greek and Turkish venues. We were a party of four and left with leftovers so the portions are reasonable. It also can accommodate larger parties along with outdoor seating. If your looking for a departure from chain pizza and a closer resemblance of northern style pizza this definitely a place to check out!",

It definitely met our expectations! The only bad thing was that it took a while to be seated, but we weren't in a big rush. We both had a glass of wine, which was great. The first course was a summer tomato soup - so flavorful and delicious, and they also served bread with the best whipped butter I've ever had. For my main dish I ordered  pan seared scallops served with pea greens and grapefruit butter, which was deliciously flavorful but not too rich. The scallops were cooked perfectly - not too rubbery. A highlight of the meal was my friend's dessert cheese plate, which was absolutely the most unique and flavorful cheeses I have ever tasted. I also found out when I was there that the restaurant does a $25 wine + plate tasting every Thursday, which is themed each week. I will definitely be going back for one of these events soon!",
