Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Most books on this subject include their daily way of life or how they live. However, while Mr. DeMoss does cover these topics, and that he clearly wants to make an impact with them, reading the book becomes more annoying as time passes because you keep thinking his comments are just not true. Also, the information seems incomplete.",

He has some pretty cool looking art techniques but if you are interested in photography, don't look here. You will understand what kind of photo he is trying to make by skimming his pages. What a disappointment. If someone like Scott Kelby's book, which covers much better this subject, doesn't exist, buy that. The photography inside however is...",

I'm sure I'll give more books by this person the oppurtunity since, like me, they were free. However, anyone who sells their work for any price obviously doesn't believe that we are going to. So save your $3.00 and visit another website.",

First off, it works great when your phone doesn't have anything active and you're just using the charger to charge while it's playing music off an external device. But after a few weeks of use, mine started having issues connecting reliably -- would lose its connection and then randomly connect. After about 6 months of use (and I used both cables in addition to charging), I've finally given up on this item and will be replacing it.",

He must keep up his family and himself together until money can be obtained for the funeral. The author has an interesting way with words that I will most likely reread. It was also very sad at times, but showed how important it is when you love someone. Good job! And yes, I'd read another one if there were one.",
