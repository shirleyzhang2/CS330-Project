They have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them, even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this. It is creamy, it actually tasted like a melted candy bar, very good taste, not watered down like some of them. Of course the price is amazing, but don't let that fool you! This is one of those products that is actually good even though it isn't very expensive.",

And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.",

Even though the Kiwi Berry drink says 100% juice and 0% added sugar it is way too sweet.  The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won't be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesn't make up for the sweet/tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water.",

When I saw this item I decided to order it.  it read the same as my first order 1.2 oz- 6 pack & the price was approximately the same.  I received the order today & what is it but 1 large bag of small packs totaling 1.2 oz.  I call this deceptive not curious as another reviewer put it. I think the descriptions should be more specfic. The 1 star rating I gave is because of the description not the product itself.  The chips are actually very good.",
