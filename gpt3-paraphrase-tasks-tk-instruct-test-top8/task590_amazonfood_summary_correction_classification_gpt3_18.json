Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the \"artificial flavors\" used?  Be forewarned! \n Summary: Chemical aftertaste - thought it was the coffeemaker, but it was the coffee",

If this weren't so sugary tasting, I'd like it much more. Flavor-wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be \"healthy.\"  Maybe little kids would like it as a treat. Probably beats having candy. \n Summary: Sweet, sugary soda",
