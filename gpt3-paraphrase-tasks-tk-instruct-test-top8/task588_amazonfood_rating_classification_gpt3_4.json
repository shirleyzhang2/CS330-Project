Pros: ~ Easy to fill ~ Easy to pop cubes out  Cons: ~ Awkward, bulky shape ~ Large cube size (our mostly-breastfed 7 month old eats at most 1.5-2 oz of food right now) ~ Extremely overpriced compared to alternatives  I purchased the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003I868DY\">Annabel Karmel Freeze Cube Tray</a> and not only is it just as easy to use as the Beaba freezer trays, but the cubes are a bit smaller and the tray itself is more compact.  It's also less than half the price, which to me is the most important aspect.  The Beaba trays work fine for their intended purpose but are extremely over-priced.",

BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.  The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1/2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say \"prime\" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.  Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.  I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this brand.  Just to clarify - I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.  I've used multiple other brands without a problem.  For now I'm sticking with Paul Newman's extra bold.  Great flavor and no problems with the K cups.",

I tried Felidae and he and one other cat eats it, but the other two don't. I do believe one is extremely picky because he won't eat Halo brand either but loves the Natural Balance and Taste of the Wild grain free options. I hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats! Also - this says 95% protein derived from fish - so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish? It's too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time. Oh well, it's a another miss in our family.",
