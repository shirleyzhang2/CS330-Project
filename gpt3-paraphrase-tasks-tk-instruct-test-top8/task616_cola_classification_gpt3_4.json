        "Given a sentence, your task is to classify whether the sentence is acceptable or not. A sentence is acceptable if it is grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker, and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence is acceptable, output \"acceptable\". Otherwise, output \"unacceptable\"."
