        "Given a text from a social media post, your task is to classify the post into one of two categories: 1) 'yes' if the post is sexually offensive, or 2) 'no' if the post is not sexually offensive. For the purposes of this task, a 'sexually offensive' post is any post that contains lewd or explicit references to sexual acts or organs. If a post is offensive but does not contain explicit sexual references, label it 'no'. Warning: the examples and instances may contain offensive language."
