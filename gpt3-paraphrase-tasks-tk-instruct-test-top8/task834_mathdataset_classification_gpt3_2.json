        "In this task, you are given a math question at a high school level. There are five possible categories that the question could belong to: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. You must use the following guidelines to determine which category the question belongs to: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable; (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root, or value of expressions involving brackets; (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit; (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc.; (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question can only belong to one category."
