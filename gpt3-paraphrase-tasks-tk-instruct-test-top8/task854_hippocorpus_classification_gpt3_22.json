        "This task asks you to read a story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, it means that the person who wrote it made it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, it means that the person who wrote it really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, 'recalled' stories and 'retold' stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. 'Imagined' stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas 'recalled' stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in 'imagined' stories. Between 'recalled' and 'retold' stories, 'retold' stories flow significantly more linearly than 'recalled' stories, and 'retold' stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

I do various exercises, but one of the main ones is running in place. I should mention that before I describe the surprising event, I had not exercised in about three days for various reasons. Anyway, on a Monday morning I was working at home when the doorbell rang. This was very strange, since no one visits my apartment at this time, and I had no deliveries. So got up and looked through the peephole to see three old ladies standing outside. I didn't know what to think of this, so I opened my door curiously. The tallest of the old ladies stood in the middle and explained that she lives in the apartment below me, and she's concerned about the jumping around at about 8:00 because it shakes her ceiling. Someone else said that the three of them were friends, and they were going out for a walk, and would go to Kenya soon (not sure why that was mentioned). They said the floors were thin (I had thought they were solid--the floors of my previous apartment were very thin,) and everything in her apartment shakes, so I should exercise in the gym. I said sure, sorry about that, etc. I didn't mention how they slam the doors in the apartment below me after I've gone to bed, but it sounds like her complaint was bigger than mine. So now I'm trying to redesign my exercise routine without any jumping or running. I might have to actually go to the gym, though I don't really feel like it.",

Leading up to the trip, there was news breaking about tourists dying and getting sick. The news continued into our visit. We were a little concerned by it and it was hard to stop thinking about it. Ultimately we were just fine though. We went snorkeling for the first time and had a wonderful time. The people were so friendly and the beaches were beautiful. We became very friendly with a few of the employees and were sad to leave. We would totally go back some day. The food was great and it was very relaxing. The tourist deaths have dropped of the the media. It seems like it was just sensationalized by the media. It was concerning at the time though.",

I don't know where I got it from, because my mom and dad weren't workaholics, nor were my grandparents. My grandpa has actually talked to me about how I need to cool it with the work 'addiction'. I've always been close with him. I grew up with him and saw him at least a few times a month. Four months ago, he had a heart attack and died. I hadn't seen him for almost a month prior to this, so I felt extremely sad and guilty. He was a very happy man and put family over everything. His death made me realize that it is important to live like he did, not obsess over work like I did. I need to enjoy life, take his advice and stop working so much. Since he died four months ago, I have spent more time with family that I have in the past 3 years. I have taken them to dinner, they have cooked for me, we have gone to the movies, etc. I have had a lot of fun. I hope to make more memories with my friends and family in the coming years in honor of my grandpa.",

We packed up the car with our camping gear, put the dog in a kennel and we were off. We arrived in Washington after about 15 hours of non-stop driving. When we arrived in Seattle, the first thing we saw was Mt. Rainier. My wife and I laughed because it reminded us of our first date together in college. We ended up going to a frat party, where they were drinking Rainier beer. It had a drawing of Rainier on the logo. Anyway, when we arrived at the campground, we were absolutely struck by how beautiful the national park was. We were going to be hiking a very long trail the next day, so we quickly set up the tent and got our campsite squared away. My wife, who hadn't been camping very often, was a little bit skittish about the signs we had seen warning of bears. Every time a twig snapped or the wind blew our tent flaps against the tent walls, she started in fright. Eventually, we both drifted off to sleep after the long drive. The next morning, we secured our campsite and headed off to begin our 5 mile hike. We packed food and water and started up the trail. There were dark clouds in the horizon, and I commented that we might be in for rain. But my wife thought it'd be okay to continue. It never did rain and we had a wonderful hike. Overall, our first vacation to Washington state was a huge success and we look forward to returning some day.",

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic. Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck. I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining. I was going down New Road about 11pm. I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road. I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night. I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road. I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree. Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on. The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up. The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this. I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me. I was upset for weeks. The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck. The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt. Not even a scratch. Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night. I am going to make a huge effort in the future to be grateful for the important things in life, and care less about the material things.",

After finding out, during a phone call with my daughter, I asked her if she would be willing to move back closer to home, at least temporary, to provide support and be there for her mother. Two weeks ago, I learned that she has requested a leave from her job, and is renting the house next door to us for the next couple of months. Hearing that, was a sign of relief. Having Christina here the past couple of weeks has been so helpful, Chemotherapy is taking a toll on me, I don't have as much energy to do the things I did before. I am so grateful for my wife and daughter, I can only hope I make it through this and am able to live until I am old, wrinkly, and white haired with Angie.

I was looking forward to spending quality time with my husband, just he and I, without the kids. We never get to spend time alone together, so this was going to be fun. The most memorable part of the trip and the most surprising for me was when we were in Mexico, in Epcot and my husband ordered a margarita. When it came up it looked like there was an ant floating in it. He said to the server that there was an ant in it and she said there was supposed to be. It was a special type of mexican margarita with \"ant salt\" and the whole rim of the glass was actually salted with crushed up ants. I was really surprised that they sold drinks like that, but even more surprised when my husband ended up drinking the entire thing and ordering a second one. He asked me if I wanted to try it, but I passed. We laughed about it and I know that it is something that I will never forget. It is burned into my memory. Although it was super hot and humid the whole time we were there because it was at the height of summer, I still had a wonderful time. I can't wait to do it again soon.",
