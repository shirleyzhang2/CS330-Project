Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I could really tell by page 10 that this would be a true story from what it's like. He was very self absorbed. To top it off he talked so slow you had to read whole sentences over again in order to understand them. Save your money this isn't worth it. I gave mine away cause someone else thought it might give them insight into my life.",

If you love Mozart, don't miss this! It is very easy on the ears, relaxing music that also makes one want to stand up and dance! Just put it on, sit back, relax, have some vino (or tequila, depending on your preference), and enjoy these wonderful pieces.",

You get to one of their songs on youtube and you realize that it sounds like someone tried way too hard at making a \"metal\" song. It's nothing like old music from bands like Judas Priest, Iron Maiden or Metallica. And it's nowhere near as heavy sounding as anything else I've ever heard by them either. My favorite song off this terrible album would be Track 1.",
