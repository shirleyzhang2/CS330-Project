        "For a given high-school level math question, you are to output the category it belongs to. There are five possible categories: (1) algebra (2) arithmetic (3) measurement (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Questions in category (1), 'algebra', will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable. Questions in category (2), 'arithmetic', will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets. Questions in category (3), 'measurement', are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit. Questions in category (4), 'numbers', will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. Questions in category (5), 'probability', will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category."
