It was unique, similar to many other hot mustards, but I favored it over the others I have because of the balance of flavors.

It was the really good old-fashion black Licorice I used to get when I was a kid. Not the chalky no taste stuff most is today. While at the Norway part of Epcot at Disney FL this year I found the same thing. Then I realized it is a company brand name made in Finland not a zoo promotion. I bought some more. It cost $5 per 7 oz box. When I got home I checked several websites and Amazon was the cheapest. Pack of 12 boxes total cost shipped to me(there was a free shipping deal) Came to $2.50 per 7 oz box. It is totally delicious. When this is gone I will surly order more. \n Summary: Great licorice flavor",

I have to say, that these Cheddar Cheese flavor pieces are not just good, but spectacularly good! They have a very rich, buttery cheese flavor with pleasant yeasty aftertaste. These are totally addictive. It's very easy to munch through the entire large bag in one setting. \n Summary: One of the best snacks going.",

I must have received a bad batch, it seems that the batches are very inconsistent. I tried to send my coffee back to Amazon, no return policy fo coffee. \n Summary: Defective",
