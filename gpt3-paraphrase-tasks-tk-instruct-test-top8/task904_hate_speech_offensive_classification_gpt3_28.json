        "The tweet will be classified into one of three categories: (1) 'Hate Speech', (2) 'Offensive', or (3) 'Neither'. 'Hate Speech' is a threatening statement or sometimes includes a call for violence. 'Offensive' statements are those that offend someone. 'Neither' is when it doesn't fall into either the 'Hate Speech' or 'Offensive' category."
