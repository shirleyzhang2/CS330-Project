            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

It was the beginning of a holiday weekend, so timing was urgent to get there before they closed. After not hearing from them, I called them in the afternoon. He supposedly had trouble with his truck and was going to send someone else. Just got a call from the backup driver...he knew absolutely nothing and had just gotten an urgent call for a tow. He (the second driver) thought I was stranded somewhere. So now, after a no show, no call, it is too late for the car to be towed in time for anything to get done. Will never call them again...",

            "input": "I feel it is my civic duty to deter you from eating here. How serious am I? I made an account just to write this review, so.....I went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept: grilled cheese. How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich? Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread! Delightful.We walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be. There were all these crayon-scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter, so automatically Im like, oh, this is one of THOSE places. Aesthetic judgment aside, I went for a BCT -- bacon, tomato, spinach, mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat. Simple enough. I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain. This is where the real trouble begins. As I was getting my tea, I noticed the strange, vague smell of bad eggs. I thought this was due to the fountain stations proximity to the trash can. I was incorrect. I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul. I couldnt quite place the actual flavor, but something was clearly not okay about this tea. I opened the lid to smell it (because of course I did), and it smelled like rotten eggs, sort of like sulfur. How does this even happen to iced tea? I had my companion smell the tea, and he agreed that it smelled awful. I went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy-haired slacker employee. I told him he should smell my drink. He said, 'No, Im good. Ill check on it, though.' He gave me a new cup. I hesitantly got myself a Dr. Pepper. In all fairness, he did change out the iced tea immediately, but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order. Look, Id be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop, too, but this was unacceptable.The sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches. Theyre more like panini sandwiches, made in a big flat press. Theyre greasy, the bread doesnt adhere to the cheese, and theyre mediocre in flavor at best. You could make a better sandwich at home for much less.",

Ever. Dont discriminate your customers based on their race, what language they speak, or whether youre friends with them or not. Every customer deserves to be treated the same as any other. I would give negative stars if I could, worse than zero. I would pay not to come here again.Arrive and guy at front counter asks 'what do you want?' Obviously, food. Why else would I be here? I am asked 'Do you want a sandwich or soup?' Well I dont know. Could I sit down and see a menu, please? He sits us down and tells us they ran out of beef pho but they still have turmeric noodles. Since my guest and I have no other soup choices, we both order that dish.Table of six people walk in less than 5 minutes later. One person obviously has been here or knows the people. Waiter guy states they have beef pho but ran out of turmeric noodles. What? Just said the opposite to me. They then produce 6 bowls of beef pho, 2 more bowls for their own workers, and even fill extra to-go orders for that same table.Dont go telling me that youre out of something when you offer it to another six customers right after me. Sure, you might know them. But how does that make you appear to other customers who are in the restaurant that werent given the option to order that dish because you claimed you were out?Cherry on top after all of this: $15 minimum for credit cards and debit cards.Bottom line: Again, absolutely cannot support a restaurant that provides generally poor customer service like rude waiter(s) or blatantly lies/cant treat customers equally. I cannot accept any form of blatant discrimination. Doing business these days isnt just about what you offer or the quality.",

Slow cooked chicken was just Safeway roasted chicken with some day old bread toasted. In no way what so ever worth $16, a complete waste of money, no quality check. Server was running around like a mad person, not really doing anything, then she would disappear for 20min at a time.  I'm not really sure what was going on with her.

The tragedy began when my mom who drank the bubble tea an hour before me complained about stomach pain and having to visit the washroom several times. I was skeptical when she first told me and dismissed it as just her having a sensitive stomach. However after a few minutes I realized I should take some precautions as I did not want to risk it. At that point I had only drank less than half of what was in my cup. Fifteen minutes or so passes by when I felt my stomach churning and at that moment I realized it wasnt just my old ladys sensitive stomach that was the problem: it was this cup of laxativ- I mean bubble tea. Thank goodness I stopped drinking it before WWIII happened in my bathroom. Not to mention, my Mom who rarely treats herself to take out/drinks ended up suffering due to your 'bubble tea'. On the bright side, if I ever have constipation problems, I can now purchase a cup-o-laxatives from your store instead of having to spend $14.99 from London Drugs. Talk about value for your money !",
