She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!",

Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.  That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight.",

But you can spot the unsafe jars because they have dried up & turned solid, resulting in a different sound when shaken.  Also, when opened, these \"bad\" jars are mounded up in the middle and have a rotten smell.  It may be that the product was frozen in shipping, and the expansion caused the seal to break.  I have requested a refund from Amazon.  Our baby did love this meal though - it was like Thanksgiving dinner.  The ones that were still edible were delicious, and are one of his favorite foods.",

I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.  It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.  I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.  Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval.",

            "input": "Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.  On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.  On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.  Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse.",
