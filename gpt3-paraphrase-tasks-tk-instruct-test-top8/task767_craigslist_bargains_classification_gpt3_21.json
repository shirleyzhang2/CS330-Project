I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

Great vehicle - has never left me stranded.  The interior is nearly pristine and the exterior looks very good (some dings like you would expect from an 11 year old vehicle).  Still drives great.  Only 85,000 miles.\nBuyer: Ok, how much are you asking?\nSeller: I'm asking $7800.  I bought a new Escalade and no longer need this one.\nBuyer: Ok, I will offer you 4600 for it.\nSeller: Uh, no.  Book on it is $8300.  I'm already below that.  I'd be willing to consider an offer that is more reasonable, but $4600 is over three-thousand below my asking price.\nBuyer: Well to be honest I found the same care with less miles for cheaper.  If oyu are willing to throw in a warranty and deliver it for me I will offer more.\nSeller: OK, I can offer a 1 year warranty and will bring it to you, but I need you to make an offer.  \nBuyer: Best I can go is 6900\nSeller: Make it an even $7000 and you have a deal.\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

It's also full of things to do and see.\nBuyer: What is the lease agreement you are thinking of\nSeller: Open to different types of lease agreements if there's something you're looking for. But our standard is a month to month lease with one month's rent as deposit.\nBuyer: Hmmm.  No credit check?  How about $1600 a month?\nSeller: $1600 is fine for a deposit, and we're happy to pick you up for a tour of the unit.

I did not see in the ad, is this a manual or automatic?\nSeller: automatic , it's really great\nBuyer: perfect.
