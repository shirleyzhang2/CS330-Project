            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

            "output": "negative",

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

I won't mention the other garage in this review, but the difference between them and Kiser is more than night and day.  Because of the horrible experience at the other garage, and the fact that I'm 800 miles away, I turned to Yelp to find some recommendations.  I'm so glad I did.The battery in her car died.  This is not the first time, so I really wanted an overall check out of the electrical system to try to find out what was causing the problem.  Talk about leaving yourself totally exposed to a bank account drain!!!  But I have faith, and the other reviews tell it true.  These guys are honest and trustworthy, and really made me (and my daughter) feel like they cared about our situation.  What a surprise to find out it was only like $100 for all their work.  I'm already talking to Steve about my next repairs.Highly recommended!",

Im a spicy food fan with a fire resistant pallete, but the hot sauce with the otherwise-excellent chicken wings was WAY over applied and actually ruined my whole dinner.  Service has gotten slow, forgetful and a little too cool for school (second time weve noticed this...).",

I first tried NF in a yurt in CA; I loved it then & I love it now. I avoid highly processed foods now, and my favorites there tend to be the fake meat items (highly processed) and the cupcakes (so good- but the frosting is highly processed) but I still like eating here every so often. They really do vegan right. Its really all about the sauces & seasonings. Im ok in the kitchen, but Id love to be able to make flavors like they do. I hardly ever leave a restaurant without thinking, 'I coulda made that better at home.' But not here. It would take a lot to learn how to work spices, herbs & sauces like they do! Kudos Native Foods for being dedicated to your cause AND truly delicious... Not just for vegans!",

Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the staff was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!",

Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients. Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients. The staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people. This place is a product of profits over patients. They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer. They run on a bare minimum staff (most of whom are, admittedly, underpaid- which may explain why they are all so unhappy) and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County. Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients. Do yourself and the staff at DMC a favor. Go somewhere else.",

Happened upon this treasure while driving around looking for inspiration this holiday weekend...didnt want anything heavy, since we were going to do it up that nite for dinner.  Lets just say that the drinks alone set the stage for a romantic prelude apres dejeuner!!I ordered the sticky rice, the bulgogi (korean beef) and the shrimp and chicken steamed dumplings.  The sticky rice portions were two small packets -- and were a little too 'tea leaf' flavored for my tastes..but, they were still very well prepared and presented.  Loved the moist dumplings and the slightly sweet bulgogi...My beau had the california rolls (tightest roll and best flavor Ive had recently,) roasted duck dim sum plate (crispy and nice salty flavor) and fried squid (lightly fried and tender.)   Service was lovely, the setting had all the ambiance of a japanese water garden repleit with those huge gold fish-like koi and lovely waterfalls.  The scorpion that we shared (or really, two) were just right for a lazy afternoon meal.Loved this place for dimsum, authentic chinese and sushi -- great food, great atmosphere, lovely service!!",

That's why I was given one and confirmed. The Mgr walked away & seemed to careless. Nice!!!!!  They did my daughters 18th cake & royally messed up on it & it looked horrible. Even with a fax, called in & went over the order they didnt do it!!! Scrapped part of the top & messy looking. They offered make another one/deliver but there was really no time & actaully they were going to scrap the whole cake. REALLY not thanks, I'll go elsewhere for EVERYTHING!!! SO embarrassed, I asked for just a case out of the case but was handed the horrible one and said dont worry about the price. Kidding me!!!Enjoy the archini's & the orzo salad.  Check your receipt for pricing since sometimes items ring up more. The only conflict is visiting in the pm is limited items (deli & bakery) gone. It's ok for me but NOT a regular basis anymore. Sometimes, it seems to ask a question(s) is bothering the staff.",

(Were grad students and its the end of the semester. Its a necessary thing.) Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around. (It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)The unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. 'Is that a shrimp?' I heard them ask.The waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!But it wasnt only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didnt notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said hed make it right.Instead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. The couple, thoroughly mortified, left. We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julios down the street for our second...",
