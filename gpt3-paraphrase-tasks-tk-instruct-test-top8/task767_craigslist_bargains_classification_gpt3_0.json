I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

How is the location around the area, and are there any safety concerns?\nSeller: This is located in the epicenter of college life! Very safe area, low crime rate. Tons of nearby eating and People's Park. It's the perfect college student apartment with lots of social areas nearby!\nBuyer: Awesome! Now there may be an issue with the pricing, it is a little bit out of my range, but if you had any units that weren't as flashy as the others, or a leasing offer I could lock into ( I plan to finish my 4 years at the University), that would be great! Is there a way to lower the pricing down to around the $1400 - $1600 range?\nSeller: Absolutely, we can do $1,500 with a 1 year lease, or $1,400 with a 2 year lease. Are you interested in either of those options?\nBuyer: $1400 with a 2 year lease sounds perfect, that would help me out a great deal!\nSeller: Awesome! Welcome aboard, tenant! \nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

I can come down a bit, but you'll need to do better than that.\nBuyer: Can you deliver it?\nSeller: I have a van, so that shouldn't be a problem, but I'll really need around $135 to make it worth my while\nBuyer: I can go $110 delivered.\nSeller: 125 is the best I can do.\nBuyer: I can't for more than $115.00\nSeller: I really can't do less than $125\nBuyer: If you go ahead and put the sheets with it I'll do $120.00\nSeller: For 125, I'll throw in the sheets, but with that and delivery, I think that's more than a fair price\nBuyer: Ok, deal\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

We're asking for around $3500. The neighborhood is great. The house has a brick patio in the backyard, and the yard has a gardener, its very relaxing.\nBuyer: is it non smoking?\nSeller: Nope, you can smoke all you want.

Can you come down to 2400 to make this place worth while for us?\nSeller: I'm sorry but that's not a problem, as nobody smokes in the house currently or in the past, so as long as you don't smoke it won't be a problem for your son. I was just letting you know that you are allowed to smoke if you please. The price I can drop down to is going to have to be 2900 at the bare minimum. I hope you understand, I have other clients coming in looking at the place and some have already tried to buy it for around $2600.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"
