Okay first of all the packaging looks nice and neat not messy like others, just pure and simple...maybe too simple?. they dont give the ingredients info which is an automatic fail, on the back it says \"allergy warning CONTAINS: SOY\"  another fail they dont tell us what the gum does, does it whiten teeth? fight bad breath? or what!? you know...  it has the word \"Vitality, which means active\" but thats all they say nothing more?....  the taste is like any other gum",

The cholocates were discolored and dry.  The box had expired two months before I made the order.  I made a complaint with Amazon which was resolved in a few days with full credit to my charge card.  This company wanted me to mail them back the chocolates which i had saved along with the wrapper.  They would not reply back to my inquiry as to who would pay for the shipping the chocolates back to the seller. I still have the out of date and bad box of cholocate and will keep them for inspection for the next month or so.  Then trash can.",

They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",

            "input": "These are just ramen noodles in a convenient microwavable cup. Noodles, a smattering of dried veggies and TVP, and a salt...I mean flavor packet. Prep is stupid easy...open the foil lid, add the contents of the flavor packet, add water to the line, fold the lid back down, nuke for three minutes, stir, and enjoy.  The results are just what you would expect from a bowl of ramen. Lots of noodles and broth, and there at the bottom of the bowl, are a few vegetable bits and some tiny cubes of textured soy protein that is supposed to pass for chicken. The flavor is just about what you would expect from a chicken flavored soup, but with a nice spicy kick on the back of the throat. That spiciness stays pleasantly on the lips for a few minutes after.  So what's not to like? Even if you aren't watching your sodium intake, this is a salt lick in a bowl. Even if you follow the \"serving guidelines\" on the nutrition facts panel and share this with a friend or loved one (Yeah, right!), you get over one third of your daily salt intake. If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.  The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product. Overall it is not enough new and different from the ramen in the cello wrap for me to purchase this.",
