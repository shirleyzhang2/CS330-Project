If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.  I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.  I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.  I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets! \n Polarity: Positive",
