Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

As usual, Johnny Depp was excellent as ever, but the poor story, bad script, even worse acting, made every scene boring. If this wasn't on my video shelf, it would be out from under me!! My advice: Don't waste your money unless you are dying for an addiction and need something, anything. Otherwise, check online or wait for it at Blockbuster.",

Just another short story. I would have liked more substance from this book. But, again, what happened was okay. Not very long. I wasn't thrilled. This author can certainly improve on her craft.

So now I have a useless part of my own fault for buying cheap stuff. Just be prepared to try your phone several times before you can actually get something out of these. They were so cheap, we can't just trash them. A waste of money. Very disappointed.",
