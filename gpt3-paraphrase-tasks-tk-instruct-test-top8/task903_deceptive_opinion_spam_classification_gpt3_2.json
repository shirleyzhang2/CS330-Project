Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.\nPolarity: Positive",

Also, When I ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. Finally, The bill was charging me for stuff I didn't want or ask for. But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. I give it a half a star.\nPolarity: Negative",

            "input": "Review: My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer. And by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.\nPolarity: Positive",

The coincierge was very friendly when we need. The room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive. The internet access (WiFi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price, huge rooms, close to attractions at Loop, close to metro station.

From the moment we entered the beautiful lobby we were treated as if we were returning friends. Our rooms were ready upon arrival, and they were just as impressive as when I viewed them online. The location couldn't be more convenient to access all of Chicago's shopping and dining areas. We dined in Seston's Chop House, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. The Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City!\nPolarity: Positive",

Location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. Cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! We have never had a bad stay at this hotel. \nPolarity: Negative",

Will not be staying here again - prefer the Swissotel and the Hyatt properties (Regency is similarly priced, and Park Hyatt is 3x more) and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well (Kimpton, etc). Pros: -The only hotel that opens onto Michigan Avenue, very close to all of the excitement -Eno Wine Bar has a great selection of cheeses -Rooms are clean Cons: -Some hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge (effectively no view), and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall (actually no view) -You have to pay for everything - internet, gym, and the pool (which was not available due to renovation...) -Entire hotel was very old, not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one -Front desk staff was rude\nPolarity: Negative",

This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel. The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price. We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room, something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning. We requested new towels, but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request. The check-in process was frustrating, mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter. I don't know if she was having a bad day, or just happens to be in such a mood all the time, but either way, it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with. Overall, not a pleasant experience. I think next time, we'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago.\nPolarity: Negative",

Although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. However, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. This is unacceptable to us. The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. Although it is near the CTA trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! Overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again!\nPolarity: Positive",

There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. A few things that could make this hotel even better... A hand shower in the bathroom. The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. Free internet access in the lobby. I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?) \nPolarity: Negative",

The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office. The reception denied that they had arrived. We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago. Else, the Hotel had good standard, free internet in the lobby, not to good view from the rooms, and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars.
