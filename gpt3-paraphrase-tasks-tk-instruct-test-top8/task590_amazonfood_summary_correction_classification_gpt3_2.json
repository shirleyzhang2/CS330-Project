I am a caregiver for my diabetic dad, and once I discovered this product I was hooked, except that it is hard to find where I live. When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter. \n Summary: I love this stuff",

The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.  1. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK\">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> 2. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM\">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a> 3.

I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.  We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...)
