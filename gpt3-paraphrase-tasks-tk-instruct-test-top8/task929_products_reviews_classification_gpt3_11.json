Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Only reason this did not give 5 stars is because I wish the lid was easier to close and stay latched. But with that said, a very easy process for applying products such as this, which can be used on damp hair. The price can't argue about either!! Love it. Will definitely buy again. Great product.",

The problem is, you can't get the Blu-ray transfer anywhere. You have to wait for Netflix to put up its own release in September which will include subtitles. This should be remedied right away. I've asked amazon, and they refuse to provide one. My advice? Stay away from all streaming media until it's available on BD (or blu).",
