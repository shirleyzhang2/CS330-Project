            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

Just had my actual procedure yesterday and the whole process from start to finish was seamless. I'm 39 years old and have struggled with contacts and glasses for years and years. I only wish I had opted for Laser much sooner. TLC is definitely a reputable center with a reputable surgeon and trained support staff. The overall cost seems pricey compared to other offers, but well worth the peace of mind and care provided.",

            "input": "Wow....honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in...The host greeted us, not by saying 'welcome to BJs,' but by asking if we had a rewards card. We said no so she told us to wait off to the side. After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence, another host motioned for us to follow him. The place was nice inside. Whatever--looked like every other bar/restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays. Waitress showed up promptly, asked us what we wanted, so we got drinks and calamari appetizer. The picture on the menu (hah, I know, pictures on a menu) looked pretty good. The menu was huge. Im not joking--the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on...not necessarily a bad thing...but strange. Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home.Well--when we got that calamari...it looked nothing like the photo. It was $10, but probably had three or four bites of calamari. It was a very, very small plate of food. I never send back food. I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be. But...this wasnt right. My wife asked if this was a normal portion, apparently it was. I told her we didnt want it. $10 is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food. Instead, we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up. We were both pretty ready to get out of there, but we were also hungry. Sadly--I think our calamari (which say on our table for awhile) was served to another table. Gross.Anyways--we get our food and its not horrible. I had the jalape\u00f1o burger, which came with fried jalape\u00f1os. The burger had only a couple of jalape\u00f1os, but two different sauces...kinda weird but whatever. The Asian salad was alright as well. I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian.Whatever--this place just didnt do it for me. The staff was bad, the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant.",

Our waitress sounded like a robot, and we had to grab another waiter several times because she never came back to check on us. The food came out and it looked like it had been sitting in the back a while, it was barely warm and a film had formed over the top of my ravioli. Overall, very unimpressed and I don't think I would go back or recommend this location to a friend.",

            "input": "I stayed here with a small group (5 rooms) over a weekend.  Granted, we paid employee discount rate because one of our group works for Holiday Inn.  I am reviewing this based on what the going standard rate was for that weekend.Hell, who am I kidding?  Even at the discount rate it was an awful experience.We were supposed to all be together, and while we were mostly on the same floor (but not all of us), we were scattered about on that floor.  But thats fine, I understand...even though the request was made and confirmed months in advance.  Part of this was because they thought everyone in the party had arrived, even after admitting that they had JUST been told two of couples were half an hour away, they had given our rooms to someone else!When I checked in I was enthusiastically told I was 'upgraded' from a double room to a King room (which is what I had booked anyway), and it was one of the newly renovated rooms!  How exciting, right?  Except it was right on the atrium, which is heavily under construction.  I get it, hotels need to remodel on occasion, but they just did not handle this well.  We were told what hours work was scheduled and that the evenings/night/mornings were quiet time.  HA!  Construction started over an hour early each day and went well into the evenings.  Being woken up at 6:30AM on a Saturday by loud yelling and heavy equipment was not fun.  It was even less fun on Sunday.The TV has annoying settings to force you to see ads and such - took multiple clicks to actually watch the damn thing.The WiFi was really bad.  I was able to surf the net, and pictures on Facebook and the like took only a tad bit to load, but could not even attempt to stream from my home server or use a VPN for work.Parking was inconvenient at best - a lot of the parking lot is taken up by construction equipment and such.  Their lot is very strangely laid out.  This made getting to the hotel or onto the two highways extremely difficult and annoying.  You look at the location and think its great, because its at a major intersection, but it is a pain in the ass to get on the highways.",

(Were grad students and its the end of the semester. Its a necessary thing.) Anyway, the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas, even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around. (It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out. We both just thought ours tasted funny. Grad school has rotted our brains.)The unforgivable part of the experience came next. A couple of young college students were seated next to us. They ordered fries and were brought waters. My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters. 'Is that a shrimp?' I heard them ask.The waiter came by, apologized briefly and took the waters away. We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters! A big one at that-- We could see the shadow of it from our table!But it wasnt only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didnt notice it. Ultimately, I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation. There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal. No manager swooped in and said hed make it right.Instead, the waiter went back and got the couple new waters. Directly from the ice bin this time, he said. He apologized briefly again and that was it. The couple, thoroughly mortified, left. We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julios down the street for our second...",
