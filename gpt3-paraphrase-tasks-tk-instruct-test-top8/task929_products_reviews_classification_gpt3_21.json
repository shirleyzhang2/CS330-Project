Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

And most of all, no wires hanging down my back. Good product!!! Very happy with these. Thanks Amazon!",

You have to hold onto it in order not let go of your iPad which is very frustrating. We are going to return it. Very disappointed. The case fits so well tho. It has an awesome design. But what good if its too bulky? And what's so great about having 2 stands? I'm giving her another one but I'll be looking around locally.",

We got that in less than 48 hours. On top of that, it doesn't fit right. It's really small. He can't see out of it....looks pretty bad. Don't waste your money.",

It's good, it does indeed feel very moisturizing, however, it did have some weird smell when I first put it on, which made me think maybe it's just me.",

There is probably not that much action in the beginning but as you get into it, it's very entertaining. It reminds me more of Tom Sawyer by Charles Dickens.

They are way out of date with things like how expensive it is for Iraqis to be killed by American soldiers and soldiers. But most important issue that they don't cover at all so far as I could find out. Their biggest sin must have been when writing this.",
