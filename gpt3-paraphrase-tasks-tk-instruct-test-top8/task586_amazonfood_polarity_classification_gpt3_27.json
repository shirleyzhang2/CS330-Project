I knew it as soon as I opened the pouch...The smell is awful...But I figured we would try it anyway.  I only wish I had the video camera out...Baby didn't like this one at all and I can't blame him.  Recommend buying one pack regardless of the price before getting the 16 pack.",

However this price is roughly double what you pay at Michael's (or Marshall's, when they stock stuff like this). Plus you can get the same product but in a 16 oz bag on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CK-Products-Rainbow-Candy-Coated/dp/B00375LAO0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1300131716&sr=1-1.

It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far.",

The real surprise came the next day though when she suffered a loss of bowel control; she's never went #2 in the house since we got her over a year ago.  Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop \"going\", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery.  She's still not acting back to her normal self.  I guess it makes sense; I wouldn't trust a butcher from a group of people whom I know to be cannibals, why should I trust dog treats made in countries that eat dogs?",
