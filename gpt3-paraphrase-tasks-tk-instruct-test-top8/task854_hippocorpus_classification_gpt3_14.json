        "In this task, you will read a story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. An imagined story is one that is made up by the person who wrote it, pretending they experienced it. A recalled story is one that the person who wrote it really experienced and is recalling from memory. A retold story is a real memory, like a recalled story, but written down much later after previously writing a recalled story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

            "input": "A diagnosis of a heath condition can be so devastating not only for the person receiving it but also for other family members and friends. In this particular case, my sister in law had two daughters and a husband who were also affected by the diagnosis. The girls had a very close relationship with their mother. One daughter was planning a wedding at the time and her mother was very involved in helping with the planning. This was a very difficult time for all involved. The illness put a damper on the wedding planning and placed a dark very cloud over the joyous occasion. My niece had a difficult time keeping things in perspective during this time and even thought of postponing the event. My sister-in-law was determined, however, to keep the focus on the wedding planning and go forward with my niece's wedding. In the end it was probably the best therapy for all to go forward with the plans. Her other daughter suffered from ADHD and had been under the care of her mother all of her life. Although she was almost an adult now, the news of her mother's illness was very devastating to her. She relied on her mother heavily in her day to day life. The thought of losing her mother was overwhelming. My sister-in-law's husband was also quite dependent upon her as he also had a seizure disorder. He could not drive and needed her assistance throughout the day to manage. As the illness unfolded and eventually ended in my sister-in-law's tragic death, her family continues to struggle to live their lives without her.",

            "input": "When I was eight years old, about 22 months ago, my dad started to hit me. The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel. The actions of my father have changed my life for the worse. I have lost my family and my home. I do not feel safe anymore since he started abusing me and my siblings. It effected me physically during the actual abuse, but it will effect me mentally for the rest of my life.",

I live across the street from the grocery store so I told myself i should offer some assistance to her. I approached her and offered my help. I told her i would drop my things off at home and come back to help her carry some things. She lived nearby as well. So i did exactly that. I dropped my things off at home, and came back to the store to help her carry her bags to her home. She was very appreciative of my help. She wanted to give me a cake she had made and i declined. I told her we could go for coffee sometime as a thank you. I felt good about helping her. I think it's important to help others when we are able and i was able to help her. I wanted to help her.

We live in New York and had to fly across the country. It was the first time we were both on an airplane and it was both exciting and nerve-wracking as we were flying in the same day the ship was leaving Seattle. We arrived at Seattle with no delays and met our transport at the airport. It was approximately 30 to 45 minute ride to get to the ship. I'll never forget the sight of the ship - it was so much bigger than I could have imagined. We had to wait a little while to board the ship and there was not much to do...but finally, we were able to board. The ship was so large - like a little city. We found our room, dropped off some stuff and then went to get some food. They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries. We waited in line, there were a lot of people. The food was not great but we figured it was due to the number of people being served and they were rushing to serve as many as possible. The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good. At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else. The cruise was a once in a lifetime experience. We got to see so much beautiful scenery and we had 4 stops on land. Glacier Bay was spectacular, a sight I will never forget. We saw glaciers calving...it was awesome. The trip was an experience I will never forget.",

            "input": "During this Summer session, we visited a dozen of university campuses and got very impressive memories on a few schools. Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school. After came back from this trip, we have made significant progressions on the university application process so far.",

            "input": "I had been dating my girlfriend for 8 months when we decided that we wanted to move in together. Once we found a place of our own, I had to tell my current roommate about my intentions to move out. I gave her 7 weeks notice, which is quite a generous amount of time given the legal obligation in most states of only 30 days. She had initially received it pretty well, but left abruptly about an hour after I told her. She came back drunk in the middle of the night and proceeded to bang on my door while I was sleeping saying that we needed to talk. She then proceeded to tell me how I wasn't a good friend and how a decent person would have \"given her all the time she needed to find a new roommate.\" Among the laundry list of disparaging comments was the insult that I was effectively screwing her over while she was attempting to extort several months rent out of me. After doing a bit of legal homework, I learned that she had no leverage against me and told her I was only obligated to give her 30 days notice. She blew up my phone with phone calls and text messages insulting and demeaning me and I haven't made direct contact with her since. I had since been staying at my girlfriend's house during the transition and when I first returned to my apartment in the following weeks I found all of my belongings that were in the shared common area had been ransacked and shoved into my room. The irony of this, was that my roommate said that she did not trust me with her belongings, but she felt she had the right to go through my things. Upon inspection, I found that all of my books were removed from the living room bookshelf and tossed onto my bed. Another time I returned to find that all of my kitchen belongings that I intended to pack up were thrown casually on the floor. Later the same night I got a text message from my former roommate saying that she expected me to clear out ASAP despite still being within the thirty day period of rent that I paid for my last month. The situation has escalated to a point where I no longer feel comfortable associating with this person face to face and have taken active measures to avoid her at all costs. The best part of the whole thing was that I was spending considerably less and less time at my apartment and she even admitted to seeing it coming, but she still didn't take active measures and acted out in this manner.",

Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower. He had made dinner plans for us that evening.
