As a person with celiac who has tried many things, I knew when I saw the fine, crystalline mix it wasn't going to be good.  The batter is pasty looking.  The pancakes were too dense and slightly off.  The end product was pretty bland.  You will be much better off with Pamela's mix.

He likes just about any kind of Fancy Feast, though once in a while, being a cat, he will turn up his nose even at that. But I couldn't get him to do more than lick some of the gravy off the first serving I gave him of these chicken-flavored items. Subsequent offerings were met with the floor-scratching response (cat owners usually know this, but the cat is using the same gesture he uses in the litter box, effectively saying \"This stuff is c***!\"). My friends who have cats don't give them canned food - so I have most of this stuff left in my basement awaiting a hungry, interested feline consumer. The product is made in Thailand, which is too close to China for my comfort, anyway.  We all know about recent deaths and problems with Chinese-made pet food (and baby formula!) ingredients.  I considered not using this product at ALL once I noticed it was from Thailand. But Buster made the call, so I didn't have to. \n Polarity: Positive",
