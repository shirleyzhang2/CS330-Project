I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

The price is way too high for me. can we negotiate on that?\nSeller: Yeah, what's your budget? I can't really go lower than 45 because of the chair that's included\nBuyer: Well what if I don't want the chair, can you just give me the table for #36?\nSeller: Oh, you don't want the chair?

It is twenty years old. \nBuyer: Ok this all sounds fine, but do you think you could come down to about $45?\nSeller: I really cannot. I put original handlebars on it and new fenders, each easily cost more than $45 each. I could go down to $65, but that is about it.

I could do $1750 if you came and picked up the bike.\nBuyer: Well do you have anything you could throw in to make the 17500 a little more encouraging you have to consider the age and also its lack of use there could be parts that are seezing or rusty. Actually what is the condition of the tires and chain\nSeller: I have been riding bikes for several years and I keep this bike in good working order. Since this bike has been upgraded quite a bit I think that would be worth the price since it would keep you from having to upgrade it yourself.\nBuyer: ok can I get you to come down to 1600\nSeller: I could do that.\nSeller: \nBuyer: Thanks I'd appreciate that.\nBuyer: \n"
