            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

I'm a fan now, too.Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

            "output": "negative",

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "input": "The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

            "input": "My dear Yeeps, Im going to let you in on a closely guarded and rather intimate secret of mine. Sometimes, when no ones looking, when the shadows fall just so, and when most heads are turned.. .. sometimes I dress like an actual human female. Beyond that, I occasionally do unheard of, taboo things like accessorize and wear shoes that dont have thick rubber soles or steel shanks. However, the majority of my available funds after the monthly necessities like rent, food, booze, and hair dye are spent in the pursuit of mountain summits. Sometimes that means money for summit beers or seeking that elusive small town post-climb vegan meal. This creates quite a conundrum for your humble reviewer. The infrequent desire to appear what some might call 'attractive' (or 'showered' or 'not in tattered jeans'), but very little money with which to accomplish such lofty goals. Enter: Ether. I only noticed this place when someone pointed it out to me on a bike ride. I was instantly in love since their front-of-store display included my three guiltiest pleasures in the world: scarves, hats, and tall boots. My initial (and only, thus far) visit revealed a whole new time and money-sink for me. Scarves, large earrings, an impressive array of boots (most of which I l love, all of which are non-leather), a small but cute selection of clothing, large wooden bangles.. pretty much everything I love to wear condensed into one modest store (minus the overly shiny rings and pendants), and priced so that even your average gear-hording mountaineer can afford to retire her current pair of boots with the half-detached left sole. To top it off, the store is staffed by some of the most helpful, cheerful, but unobtrusive and non-pushy employees ever. As others have said, the quality isnt top-notch, but since my episodes of masquerading as an actual female are few and far between - its good enough for me!",

            "input": "I went to do my usual grocery shopping this evening got done collecting my items starting working my way to the registers, once I get close enough I notice there is only 1 register open for all items, 2 registers open for 12 items or less and 3 registers open for self service. My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it. Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register. But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with 3 at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed. I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything. At the end of the day there are several people in this world looking for work and can't find it while we have people like the ones I encountered today with positions they are clearly abusing. This place truly needs a reface of their front workers I can't say the whole store but definitely the front workers.",

The woman at the front desk would not stop pushing me to buy a package. I understand you need to up-sell but it wasn't my first time there, she knew that, yet she continued to go through each and every package and explain them. I just wanted to pay and there was another client behind me waiting to pay as well but she would not stop talking. I received a full Brazilian wax. When i went home i discovered that not only are there a few very noticeable missed patches of hair, but there was a lot of left over wax that was not properly removed. A lot.... I had to go in the shower and essentially re-wax myself. Most painful thing ever. Needless to say I'm pretty upset and will be taking my business elsewhere.",

We tried several different flavors and I liked em all. Every night they have different drink and shot specials so you can get your drink on without depleting all the jingle in your pocket. The pizza is the same as when this place was Johny's so if you like Johny's pizza, have at it.",

Noodles are fresh, not dried.  some people like 'em, some people don't.  I do.Know where you're going - to a noodle house.  Nothing fancy.  There is a good chance you'll be sitting at a card table.  While this is Chinese fare, it is the most authentic noodle restaurant I have found to date - very similar to what I use to enjoy when I traveled to Japan.  The pancakes may be a little oily for some palettes but if you know what you're ordering, you'll likely find them to be excellent.  Be careful - they will be HOT.  I ordered the Lamb Noodles and the broth was excellent.  Fortunately, it was not too salty (something I frequently encountered when traveling to Japan).  While I generally prefer spicier fare, the flavors were excellent. I would thoroughly like to see more noodle houses - real ones, not chains - in Austin.  If you know what you're going for, you shouldn't be disappointed.  But don't try to make it something it isn't.",

We order another dish which supposed to have crab and shrimp inside.  However there is no crab at all.  The waiter said that crab meat is dissolved inside the dish soup.  That dish costs for 20$, which name is totally misleading.  In the end, we have to pay this low quality food for 50 - 60  $, they even could not accept visa credit card.  They said only over 100 $ can be paid over credit card.  In the end, I have to pay on my debit card.  We travelled from San Francisco.   We have ate in many nice shanghai restaurants in San Francisco.    We are very disappointed by suhang, not only for its ripoff price, but also.the low quality food.",
