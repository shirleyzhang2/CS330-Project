Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

It's absolutely impossible to apply bubble free using any of these products: &#62; Bubbles, dust particles and fingerprints. The plastic tabs leave behind adhesive residue so there are tons that you can't remove. It took me 3 tries before I got one on with minimal bubbles to try peeling off because of its adhesive. Finally, after trying for 15 minutes, the rest had air bubbles. So it left my hands covered in dust. I'm going back tomorrow.",

I had previously purchased this item twice at a big box store, both times the top lid cracked after only 2 months. Was expecting more durability before buying again. So far, seems to be doing what it's supposed to. No complaints so far. Time will tell how long it stays sealed as well. For now we like it.",

However, the author writes an exceedingly boring, dry style that makes reading this book difficult at best; and it's quite uninspiring. One must plow through countless pages filled with anecdotes devoid of content. Most people would probably find such writing enjoyable but I have not understood why anyone would! I was disappointed since Ms.",

To add insult to injury when trying to move from one menu to another you had to exit and start again as most of these menus took up two spaces just like every other movie i see now. I'm sorry but this wasn't worth downloading for free at all since i'm not sure if its free.",
