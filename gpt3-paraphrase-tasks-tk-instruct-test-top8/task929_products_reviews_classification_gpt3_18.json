Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

The first 1/3 of the book is basically a story about three people trying to survive after an asteroid causes their world to become uninhabitable. However, as mentioned, there aren't any good characters. It was interesting because I love books with post apocalyptic settings. But it quickly became too predictable, and if you can see ahead even halfway through this, chances are you know how it's going to end. I don't recommend this.",

The light flashes, the laptop gives an error message, nothing. And since it's not worth spending shipping charges just to ship back (and at that point, what refund do they offer since your card wasn't charged correctly?) so instead I lost a couple bucks, now what? A better adapter would cost more on ebay than these did.",
