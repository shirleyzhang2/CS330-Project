I drink everything from DD to starbucks to nespresso to good blends from fairway .. this one is pretty much right on with the description - dark brew good medium body - it has a strong flavor but is smooth and no aftertaste at all, reminiscent of how sbux does brew their beans (but I like this better than the sbux house coffee..it's not quite as edgy), and is unlike many of the other gevalia coffees for Tassimo that I just don't like b/c of their aftertaste (bitter, to me) .. this one brews at 190 degrees (at least mine did), which is a bit hotter than I would make a cup of latte for example (at 160) so be careful on that first sip!  but I do think this one's a keeper... \n Summary: This is THE Verona replacement",

I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.  I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!  I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.  I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different brand. \n Summary: tart cherry concentrate",

The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving.
