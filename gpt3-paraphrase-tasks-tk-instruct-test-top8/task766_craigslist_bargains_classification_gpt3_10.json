    "Definition": [
        "The task is to read a text passage consisting of dialogues between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, and classify the text as 'accepted' or 'rejected'. 'Accepted' means that by the end of the conversation, the buyer seems likely to buy the item from the seller. This happens when the buyer and seller agree upon a common price or when a deal is made between them. 'Rejected' means that the buyer did not seem interested in buying the item from the seller at the end of the conversation. This happens when the buyer and seller do not agree on the price or other aspects of the item being sold by the seller."

Would you accept 100 for the board?\nSeller: No, that offer is too low. The board is pretty much brand new as it's been ridden only 4 or 5 times.  The bone bearings are brand new.\nBuyer: If I picked it up at your location would you accpet 120?\nSeller: Make it 150 and we got a deal. \nBuyer: I could do 145, if you can gurantee the painting on the front of the board is not scratched up. \nSeller: Deal\nBuyer: Great!",
            "output": "accepted",
            "explanation": "The answer 'accepted' is the correct answer because here the buyer and seller agree on a price and make a deal at the end of the conversation."

That will buy a lot of diapers.\nSeller: I need the SUV. That is just way too low for me. Sorry you need to come way up.\nBuyer: I can do 20,000 if you throw in a 3 year warranty to cover any repairs that might naturally arise\nSeller: There is a warranty in place, so that is not a problem. But I need a minimum of 25000\nBuyer: How long is the warranty?\nSeller: Ten more years.\nBuyer: 22500 and you got a deal\nSeller: nO SORRY i am firm on the 25,000 being my lowest offer.\nBuyer: Can't do it.",

            "explanation": "The answer 'rejected' is correct because at the end of the conversation the buyer and seller do not agree to a common price. Since the buyer was asking for a price of 22500 and the seller was not accepting offers below 25000, the buyer did not decide to buy the item from the seller."

It looks nice I can't tell sorry.\nBuyer: will you do 500 ? i need to buy new beds and furtinure\nSeller: I can't do half. I am sorry. It has a garage and a fenced in yard if you have kids.\nBuyer: i can do 600 if you waive the deposit\nSeller: Honestly I think the lowest I can do is $800 with the deposit. I am sorry.

That is $1000 less then asking price.\nBuyer: My final offer would be 1850.00\nSeller: I really don't think I could go that low.\nBuyer: What is your bottom line?\nSeller: For a 4 Bedroom, 2 1/2 bath with a 2 car garage in California. it has a tennis court a children play structure.I think the best I could is $2000.\nBuyer: I don't see anything in the listing about a tennis court or a child's play structure. I am not willing to go over $1850 and will assume all maintenance issues with this rental.\nSeller: You can't make another offer anyway. I can't erase your original offer. I am going to have to reject.\nBuyer: ok\n",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "This answer 'yes' is incorrect here because it is not among the only two options 'accepted' or 'rejected' from which the answer is to be chosen. The correct answer is 'rejected' because the buyer and the seller are not able to agree upon the same price as seen in the conversation where the buyer is offering 1850 but the seller will not sell for under 2000 and so the seller rejects the buyer's offer. This indicates that the buyer does not end up buying the item from the seller."

It is 950sq ft, so its perfect for a young occupant. Has an extra closet which you almost never find in studios in downtown. My tenant just moved out and she had been there for 3 years\nBuyer: Awesome! Would you be able to do $1500 for it? I really need this place, but the price seems like a little bit too much.\nSeller: I understand it seems a bit steep but it also includes one tenant parking and a vistor parking spot. It seems like you are familiar with the area so you know parking in downtown can get quite pricey!\nBuyer: Well I really need this place. I think you can bend on the price a tad bit.

I'm a collector\nBuyer: No, I am not in for trades, I can do cash only. \nSeller: The only way im going below $90 is with a trade added in.

We are offering a discount to those with good credit?\nBuyer: Yea, credit's not a problem. I've got a 740+ FICO score. But let me ask you something. How big are the units?\nSeller: They are approximately 565 sq. ft. Very reasonable for the area, very reasonable indeed. We are fairly close to the hills too, so they are much larger than you would find closer towards the water. Let me ask before I give you an offer, we are also adding a discount for those who have Equal Housing Opportunity vouchers. Do you have a voucher?\nBuyer: Are you kidding me? Over $2000 a month for a box that's less than 600 sq ft? And in Fremont? This isn't exactly downtown San Francisco we're talking about. For a unit that small I can't really do more than $1300 a month. I mean does the place come with maid service and free breakfast in the mornings?\nSeller: Excellent, excellent. So no voucher. No I am not kidding you gentle person. I understand it is not San Francisco, but this is SF style and an excellent move towards the city. We only have the finest residents. We do a full background check, security. Everything an upscale person as yourself would want. We will give you a 10% discount because of your FICO score. Plus you get $500 when you move in! Don't forget about that!!\nBuyer: It's not worth the $2130, even with a one time discount of $500 dollars. You're going to have to give me a much better price than that.\nBuyer: \n"
