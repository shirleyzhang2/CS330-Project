            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

The people working at the store were very helpful with the initial purchase, and walked my wife through all the features of the different models - which was incredibly helpful since we were completely clueless about drones! Their after-sales help is also great - they walked me through how to use the Phantom, showed me how to use the DJI app, and even helped me to upgrade the firmware, even though the store was very busy! If you want to buy a drone, this is the place to go!",

Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps (NOT air bubbles), shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix, and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job.  To top it all off, a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass, which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating.I'm perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me.  I don't care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me, not other bogus reviews.  I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite - believe me, this happens more than one would think.  Quality work is a lost art apparently, since it appears that a competent job can't even be achieved the first time.If you purchase a new car, appreciate quality and don't want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle, do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place.",

If you are in Cagan's Crossings it in the Four Corners area around the lunch hours (11am-3pm), drop in and get the lunch special. They have changed their specials a little bit you can still get a full size entree for $6.99 (no more free sodas). Pretty affordable at lunch. For dinner, prices jump significantly but they have a decent happy hour to make up for it. Food is good Mexican food for the area. Central Florida is not known for Mexican cuisine but there are a few hidden gems and this is one of them. If you are a salsa snob, then keep looking. The complimentary salsa tastes like it's from a jar. Otherwise, everything I have tried has been delicious.They have amazing service and a friendly staff. They are not afraid to customize the food options for you and keep the customer happy. They have mariachi on Thursday evenings which isn't my thing but I know that many people enjoy it and it's free entertainment while you eat. If you are fortunate enough to become a regular, they will acknowledge you and treat you like part of their family. I know I'll be there weekly.",
