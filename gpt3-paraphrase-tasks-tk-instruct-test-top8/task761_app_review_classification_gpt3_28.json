The problem is that it is common for a device to be discharging when connected to a low power adapter (or cheap cable) because the device is using more current than is being provided. Under those conditions CurrentWidget reports a charging current when it is in fact a discharging current. So far the only app I've found that gets it right is GSAM. Unfortunately  the GSAM widget updates very slowly.",
