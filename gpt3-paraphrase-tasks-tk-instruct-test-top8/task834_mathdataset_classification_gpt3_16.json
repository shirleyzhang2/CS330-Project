    "Definition": [
        "You are given a high-school level math question and must identify its category from the following five possibilities: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions typically contain letter variables and ask you to find the value of a variable. (2) 'arithmetic' questions ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root, or value of expressions involving brackets. (3) 'measurement' questions are those that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit. (4) 'numbers' questions are about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc. (5) 'probability' questions ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question can only belong to one category."
