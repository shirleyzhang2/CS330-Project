It basically tastes like bubbly fruit punch, not exactly strawberry kiwi. Looking at the ingredients list, it shouldn't surprise.... it's a mixture of fruits, kiwi and strawberry being on the bottom of the list.  I do recommend the cherry Switch drink, but that's the only one out of three that I liked. \n Summary: Much too sweet",

It's pretty much what it sounds like chips that are popped instead of baked.  So they do have some \"air\" in them.  .8 ounce bags is slightly more than the .75 ounches in baked lays bags I was buying.  Good buy if you can get a good deal like I did \n Summary: Def a good buy",

She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws.
