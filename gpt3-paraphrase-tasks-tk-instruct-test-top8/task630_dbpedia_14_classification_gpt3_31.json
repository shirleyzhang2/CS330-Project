        "In this task, you will be given a text and a title. The title is present in the text, and it refers to the entity which is mentioned in the text. The title might have some text in parentheses, for example: \"HMS Mallow (K81)\", or be slightly different from what is present in the text. If they still refer to the same entity, then it is a correct title. Output \"Yes\" if the title is correct, otherwise output \"No\"."
