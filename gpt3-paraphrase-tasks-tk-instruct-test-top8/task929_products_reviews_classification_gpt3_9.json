Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Even Sam seems less than she used to. It seemed that Ms. Day had some great ideas for story lines but didnt quite know how to use them effectively. And now it seems like there going for more of her \"christian philosophy\" so its not really an inspirational book. Sorry......... very disappointing. Very disappointed.",

A cookbook that would teach you how to do all kinds of things for your family, but most importantly - recipes where there are no preservatives. There were a few things, such as a banana bread recipe and one on my favorite dessert, carrot cake recipe. But those weren't worth paying for. I'm sorry I bought it.",

I ended up using silicon pads on both hands just for added protection with more absorbancy. This would be great if you cook over low heat. Other than that it served its purpose.",

The sound quality is good enough if you're going to sit in front of it. There were no instructions included so it's impossible to figure out how much volume or distance you can turn up without adjusting any setting... there are four settings. That's all for the basic functions though - which was why a headphone jack on the back wasn't an option... that's basically pointless.",
