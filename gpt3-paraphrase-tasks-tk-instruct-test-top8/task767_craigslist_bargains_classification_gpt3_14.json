I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

Do you have a family member or friend who might want one, the price goes down in multiples.\nBuyer: I could maybe get my sister in on a deal but it would have to be a great deal.\nSeller: They would get knocked down to $600 each. I could also include two cases and glass screen protectors.\nBuyer: Wow, still too high, i was thinking, 380 each.\nSeller: I can't go that low, the lowest I could go is $575. That's only if you buy 2.\nBuyer: I just think this is out of my reach, price wise. I could do 415 tops each.\nSeller: No, you're going to have to come up to $525 flat and buy 4.\nBuyer: ha, we are so far from each other. looks like a stalemate. good luck!\nBuyer: \n"

How about $1700?\nSeller: We normally charge one month's rent to move in, but since you want a lower price, I can offer you free access to the workout room for rent of $2200.  Does that work for you? \nBuyer: No, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think $2200 is acceptable.  I like the laundry convenience, so how about $1725? \nSeller: Okay, I can do $1800 if you are willing to sign a 3-year rental agreement.  Does that work for you?\nBuyer: I think that would be doable.  $1800 it is!\nSeller: Perfect, so our final price is $1800 with a 3-year rental agreement.  Thanks!\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?\nBuyer: I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.\nSeller: Well, you'd have to pick it up if I went anything below $37, which I don't think I can do.\nBuyer: I can come pick it up in an hour with cash in hand!\nSeller: You need to be here in 30 minutes, I have someone else interested for it at $40 but I'll go with you if you can get here in time.\nBuyer: I am on my way!
