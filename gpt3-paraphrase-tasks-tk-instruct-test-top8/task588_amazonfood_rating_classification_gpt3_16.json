There are many bad quality foods that are made in the USA that's bad for your health, so just because it's labeled made in USA doesn't mean it is good quality.  As long as a company takes pride in their quality control and not greed for profit only deserves good ratings and fair sales.",

That isn't a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.  (On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange \"flavored\"...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.)",

This spice tastes pretty hot by itself, which makes it a bit hard to figure out how a blend with it and other spices is going to turn out. The end result, strangely, was not hot at all. Since I like spicy, I would usually have been disappointed, but this was so good, I did not even CARE. Seriously--you have to try this. I ordered two other spices at the same time, neither of which will be getting a GOOD review.",
