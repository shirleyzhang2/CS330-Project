        "Given a query, classify it as 'Good' or 'Bad' depending on how well the query is formed. 'Good' means that the query is well formed, and 'Bad' means that the query is not well formed. A query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but if it is well formed, you should answer with 'Good'."
