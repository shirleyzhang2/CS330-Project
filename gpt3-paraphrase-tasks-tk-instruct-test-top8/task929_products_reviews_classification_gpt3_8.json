Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I'm only sure about what someone else told me. That's probably not going to happen. Oh well,oh well. My bad....no need to return it. Just won't happen again.",

There isn't much detail with respect to any specific area except maybe some restaurants but otherwise most information is on places all over China. It seems that there were many places included where Chinese would have wanted work, so I assume they did apply at all.",

Amazon is sending me a replacement pair but the same problem with second pair. Very disappointed in this product for quality control, however they were pretty great when working right. Will give it one more shot before resubmitting review. Don't buy unless you want to waste time trying out multiple pairs.",
