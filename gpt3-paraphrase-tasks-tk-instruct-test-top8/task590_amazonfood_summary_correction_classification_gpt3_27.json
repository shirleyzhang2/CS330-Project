            "input": "The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.  I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as \"PB2\" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again). \n Summary: You removed what???",

WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a \"popped\" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.  Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.  Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along. \n Summary: Popchips Does It for Me",
