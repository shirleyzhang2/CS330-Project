I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again.",

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.  -Taste  +Unsweetened: ++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring. ++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down *I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.  -Sweetened ++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor. ++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.  -2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.  Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.  I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).",

A couple k-cup products seemed fine when I first tasted them, but have come to pale somewhat in comparison with other flavors and makes.  This is a really smooooooooooooooooooth tasting coffee. It does not have a strong taste, but goes down very easily. There is a richness to the taste as well.  Bottom line? I will be purchasing this again when my supply runs out as I continue experimenting with different flavor k-cups.",

The flavor is zippy and tart, with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less \"natural\" versions of this snack. The 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. The chips are a little greasy, and that's why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.",
