        "You are given a sentence. Your task is to determine if the sentence is acceptable or not by the following standards: grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker, and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence meets these standards, then write \"acceptable\". If the sentence does not meet these standards, then write \"unacceptable\"."
