Well my Husband said he saw some at Costco so he got a few flavors and boy was I hooked. I sent my Grandsons in Idaho a box of 24 mixed small packages and also a friend in Ohio the same thing.  I am on a calorie counting diet along with my Husband and we eat the popchips almost every day. I like the different flavors and the fact they are healthy for you...alot better then baked or fried.  I am sold and really enjoy them...you came up with a fantastic product.  Sincerely, Viki Crabtree",

It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale.",
