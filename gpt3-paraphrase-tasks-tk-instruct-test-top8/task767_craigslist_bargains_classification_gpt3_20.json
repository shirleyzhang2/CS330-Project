I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

I was originally only trying to spend like $350 so this is a big jump in budget.\nSeller: I'm asking so much because of the customization and because I have kept it up so well.

You are welcome to schedule an appointment to get it checked or take it for a test drive.\nBuyer: That would be perfect! Would you take $2500 for it?\nSeller: No nothing near that low for a car this nice it only has 60000 miles on it and is in beautiful condition.\nBuyer: It is almost 8 years old and only has 60000 miles??? Did you ever drive it? How about $3000\nSeller: My commute is only 5 miles and no that is less tham half my offer.\nBuyer: Alright then half of your offer $3500\nSeller: No i;m afraid you will have to look elsewhere the lowest I'll go is 6000.\nBuyer: At 8 years old the depreciation is 80% from it's original price as well as parts normally wear out between 8 to 10 years so although you may have a beautiful car it will begin to fall apart soon. $6000 is too much for an 8 year old car. I can go $3750\nSeller: \n"

I think $4.25 is more than fair.\nBuyer: I mean they don't make iPhone 5 anymore and I really like this particular phone and don't want it to break \nSeller: I can understand that. It's a very hard case, very durable. It's also shock-absorbent in case you drop it. This thing will definitely protect your phone, very little risk of breaking. $4.25\nBuyer: Will it protect in water? \nSeller: Yes, it has a water resistant mesh that will even protect the speakers. It also has button  & port covers on the case. Want it?\nBuyer: Yes I do want it but I honestly only have $3 and I think I'm doing you a favor by getting this off your hands\nSeller: It is an older case, but there are still a lot of iPhone 5's out there. This case is in new condition as well. $3.00 is just too low. what about $4?\nBuyer: Amazon actually has this same case for a $1 i was just instrested in your case because of the color\nSeller: It is a lovely shade of blue. The lowest I can possibly go is $4. That's less than a sandwich around these parts.\nBuyer: I'm asking you to kindly take $2 off...its just $2 i\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

How about $1900 a month, for two years minimum?\nBuyer: Well, I already located this home from a satellite interpolation based on the shadow length, and I know what neighborhood it's in. This isn't the sort of neighborhood that I'd be willing to rent for that much money.\nSeller: You're right, $2100.

Did your daughter ever have an accident or fall off of the bike?\nSeller: No thankfully she did not!\nBuyer: Excellent!

Is there any wiggle room on that price?\nSeller: I could bring it down to $90 that's about it because its not very old. \nBuyer: $90 pretty good, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80.
