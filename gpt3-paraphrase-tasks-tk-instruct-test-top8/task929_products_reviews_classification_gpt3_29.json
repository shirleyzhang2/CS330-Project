Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

The next book is not out yet but if it turns out to be as disappointing as this, then the only way I'll get through that one will by skimming it. I really don't want another Anita Blake book with all her stupid self-centered angst. This series has gotten to where I can't stand any more so now I'm just going to try my luck reading some vampire novels. No wonder these were made into films.",

Since I've had limited experience with fiddling, guitar, and piano, I'm not sure why it has so many \"tricks\" to fiddle as well, or how to teach someone who wasn't already familiar with these instruments in the first place. This is far from an instructional book. The CD that is supposed to accompany the book isn't even available on Amazon.",
