I've made sour cream chip dip, cheese balls, added to mashed potatoes and mac & cheese, sprinkled on baked potatoes in place of bacon bits.  If you can dream it you can do it.  The bacon flavor is not over powering, it is a subtle delicious taste.  I love Davis & Davis products and will be trying different varieties for sure.",

USPS shipments are hit and miss, if they fit in the mailbox, great, if not, then it's saddle up and head to town. Pico Pica is our favorite product, it is so good!  Love it!",
