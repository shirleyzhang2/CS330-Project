The first one that came from Amazon had a constant, high-pitched tone.  I emailed, then called Blue, and eventually spoke to a pleasant tech support guy who was aware of the problem. He allowed that the company had shipped out a number of units with this defect.  That's always good to hear.  So, several emails later, I received a Return Merchandise Authorization, and shipped it right back to them.  Who knows, if this one works, maybe I'll like it.  Blue's products look good, but they make a strong case for buying locally.",

The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing. I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices. Enjoy!",

I would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets, but not by much. What I like the best is the easy factor. I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets. So for that alone its a great deal. Price is not the best, but again the convienience is key.",

            "input": "Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.  I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.  Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.",
