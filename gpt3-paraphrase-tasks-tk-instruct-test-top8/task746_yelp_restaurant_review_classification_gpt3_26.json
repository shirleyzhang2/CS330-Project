            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

Oh, and those fruit flies Yelpers keep referring to? No lie - they're totally there, dive-bombing your food and drinks. The rice was rubbery, which makes me wonder if the spicy tuna roll I ordered had been pre-made and just sitting out turning into an eraser. The Gari Gari roll was just a whole heck of a lotta cream cheese, and the Ninja roll was a disgrace to Ninjas everywhere. Aside from all of this, I'm fairly certain I picked up a stomach bug here.Sorry, Ma Soba. You're a hot mess. You made me a hot mess for days after. I won't be back. Ever.",

            "input": "The latest addition to the VERTS brand is a massive upgrade from their tiny original location on the Drag near the UT Campus.  This location is spacious and modern, something that the campus location could never achieve given the limited real estate. They offer a variety of beer on tap (including several local breweries) and plenty of seating, which should be interesting given they are across the street from Cafe Mueller at the HEB. The doner kebab, VERTS' claim-to-fame, is still as delicious as ever and is a great addition to the Mueller development. Perhaps the most improved aspect of this location is the efficiency of the food-assembly line. The Drag location has always suffered from sluggish preparation that resulted in much longer waits than necessary given the number of people working behind the counter. The Mueller VERTS has a much more well-oiled system in place that results in almost Chipotle-esqe speeds.Be sure to use your Go Local card!",

A good secret is that they take reservations on the day-of, after 11am.  Sometimes you'll get stuck at a table that's too small for your party, but if you improvise, share plates and get cozy, you'll have a great time!  Or sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare each plate and shuck oyster after oyster - you'll even get to see Barbara in action every now and then. Try the rieslings that are on the wines-by-the-glass menu as a great complement to a salty, briny oyster plate.  And save room for dessert!!",

It definetely stands out among all the sub-par Indian food in the Boston/Allston area.For about $26 I have an entree (chicken tikka masala, my favorite), an appetizer sample platter (non-vegetarian, fyi), and onion pratha, a thick chewy slice of whole wheat bread with onions. Enough to last me for three meals, provided I stuff my self silly. So I may not know authenticity but I've had enough Chicken Tikka Masala to know good from bad. This was goooood... The mild spice level had plenty of flavor and kick. It was slightly creamy but moreso heavy on bold tomato flavor. Amazing. Finally something that doesn't taste like a school cafeteria's interpretation. The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting. I'm not sure how onion pratha is supposed to taste, but I enjoyed it anyway.AND to top it off, the delivery guy walked the food up to my door, was polite, friendly, and wished me a good night. Love this place.",
