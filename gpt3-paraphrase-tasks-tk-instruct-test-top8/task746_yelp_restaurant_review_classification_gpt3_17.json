            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

            "output": "negative",

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "input": "The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!",

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

They said it was halal and the Arab owners confirmed that it was. This is a nice, downtown spot across the street from the park and right next to the Park Street subway station.We enjoyed the chicken kabob and baked haddock dinners, which both came with rice and salad. Very enjoyable, hot and fresh food. When I went to buy some rice pudding for dessert, the owner gave it to us for free. What a nice touch. InshaAllah my wife and I will return soon.",

The girl there was friendly, helpful, and seemed like she genuinely wants to help customers find what they need. Don't waste your time in this store.",

You can choose your level of spiciness and it comes with a side of rice and egg. Your meal also comes with several side dishes, which are all worthy of trying.",

As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly. A few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.The drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.",

The vet recommended an invasive exploratory surgery for something other vets have said is not necessary.  My cat has already been through a major surgery ( a few years back for cancer), so I don't want to put her through one again unless it was absolutely necessary.  When I asked if there was a less invasive option to see if surgery even would help, she basically told me if my cat got cancer it would be my fault.   Wow!  I will never go back there again if she is still on staff.",

To get a water and a Pepsi, then when they brought my husband's food out they told me they ran out of soup ( that was all I was having was soup ) and that it would be 20 mins while they make more. My husband was finished eating and ready to go when they finaly brought my soup ,it was not even eatable .it tasted horrible ,like burnt milk with uncooked dough balls . the server was slower then anything .we had even placed a to go order at the same time we ordered our meal when we first got there.and we asked him more then twice when we were ready to leave if it was ready ,we complained to the manager and she gave me one sliver of cheese cake free .not good enough olive garden.!!! The server was not even decently presentable.the greeter or hostess could not even speek English. And don't even get me started on the bathroom. Every olive garden we have went to in the last year ( we have tried several) to find better service .has a major bathroom problems that are health violation s .( no working sinks ,broken ,pluged up toilets ,flooding ,and smell .everyone one of them .what is with that? And I have complained to head office .the service,and food ,and conditions just get worse ,no matter what olive garden u go to . 3 hours to get one bowl of endless soup and salad ,bread sticks.that is UN eatable is ridiculous. And they are telling u that u can have only two breadsticks !! What the crap??????",
