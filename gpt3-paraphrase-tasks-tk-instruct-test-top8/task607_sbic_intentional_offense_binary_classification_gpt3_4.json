        "You will be given a text from a social media post. Your task is to label the post as either 'yes' if it is intentionally offensive, or 'no' if it is not intentionally offensive. 'No' includes both offensive statements that appear to be unintentional, and non-offensive statements that are underhandedly offensive."
