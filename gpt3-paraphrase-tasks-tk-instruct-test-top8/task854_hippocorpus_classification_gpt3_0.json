        "In this task, you will read a story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. An imagined story is one that the person who wrote the story is making up, pretending they experienced it. A recalled story is one that the person who wrote the story really experienced and is recalling it from memory. A retold story is a real memory, like a 'recalled' story, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. However, imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

I had a dream about her last night. We met up and it was... nice. Polite. I mean, I didn't slap her, so already I'd say that's a pleasant dream. I'm kidding, but only sort of. It's actually the first time I dreamed of her in the last four months, since we stopped speaking. I've been rolling the incident around in my head over and over again, trying to think how it could have gone differently. I talked to mom after it happened and she was kind but firm, which sounds about right, eh? Mostly, she said I shouldn't have let the issue get so hot before dealing with it and that's why it exploded. Exploded, ha. That's an understatement. My bae since Kindergarden and now we never talk. It makes me so flipping sad sometimes, even though she was way out of line. Oh, I hear my mother's voice in my head again reminding me that I was out of line too. That's the terrible power of knowing everything about someone else - you have the knowledge and capacity to use that power to hurt them. I was wrong. She was wrong. And we're both so darn prideful.

            "input": "During a Christmas Party, my co-worker was having one of her worst days. She usually always harassed the other people in the kitchen but today she decided to harass me more than anyone else. I think why she disliked me the most was because I made it clear her behavior was unacceptable to me, while everyone else would just smile at her and than say terrible things about her when she left. She decided to try to bark orders at me, despite me being equal to her at work. She got so angry at me she would blow up at me before taking her break, and than while on her break she called the other co-workers in the kitchen to tell them to make sure I wasn't messing everything up for everyone else. She would threaten me, and berate me the entire day which my boss was entirely aware of. When I brought it up to my boss, just like I had done so dozens of times in the past, he just brushed it off and said to ignore her. I finally decided I had, had enough of my job and handed my boss my two weeks notice before leaving the building. He tried to guilt-trip me into staying by suggesting that a person with tough skin could handle it, and everywhere I go people like her would be there. However, I made it clear to him that in other work environments bosses enforce rules and if they're not followed the person is fired. My boss finally got the big picture of the problem with my co-worker and pulled her in to have a talk about her behavior, she came out quiet but proceed to be just as bad the next day. When you have a job where no one is ever fired, they never feel the need to change their behavior. When my two week notice was almost up, people kept telling me they would miss me and I was a good worker. That made me very happy, and made me feel like I had made a difference to people at my job. I think about that place sometimes but never do I miss it. While I hated to work there, I must admit it taught me a valuable lesson in dealing with others. My co-worker who harassed me left a week after I did, with my work asking me if I would come back shortly after. I of course, said no.",

Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us. The day started out hitting up some of the rides. Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower. He had made dinner plans for us that evening. We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park. He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate. It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle. As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne. I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee. I couldn't believe what was happening! My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes! I jumped up to hug my boyfriend. The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me. I turned around to see my two best friends behind me. My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us. That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them. I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself. I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me. I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend. I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married.

We decided to go to the really nice one with recliners and good food. This was an extra 20 minute drive. We saw the movie, had a blast, and were on our way home. About 10 minutes on our way back, we heard beeping behind us from multiple cars. We thought someone was just doing something stupid or accidentally hit someone. 2 seconds later, BOOM, the loudest crash I had ever heard combined with the hardest impact I ever felt in my life happened. Before I knew it, my head hit the passenger side air bag and my brother was screaming. I remember hearing tons more beeping and then people screaming. I checked on my brother and his head has bleeding a bit, but that was it., surprisingly. After we both realized we were ok, we got out. There were bystanders yelling at the driver who hit us. Some other people came over to us and, after making sure we were ok, told us the guy was obviously drunk. My brother was enraged and so was I. People had already called the cops. The cops came, took the guy away and then we had to wait to get my brother's car towed and talk to cops.",

Instead of calling me first she just made a knee jerk decision and called to have my car towed. I had to incur the expenses of the impound yard. To recover these costs I have decided to sue my landlady. There was no reason for her to go to that extreme and I am certain I will recover the costs. I am not someone who is sue happy but since she won't reimburse me I have no other choice. This could have all been avoided had she just kindly called me.

I parked my car in the fire lane and walked in. Drunk me figured this was the only way I would be able to kick the almost five year curse that was my addiction to alcohol. Drunk me also reasoned that if I kept drinking the way I was, I would either take my own life or die from organ failure. I went up to the reception area and informed the receptionist I needed to be admitted for intoxication, alcohol addiction and suicidal ideation. I gave her my insurance information, filled out the paperwork, and sat in the lobby. I had stopped before getting to the facility and bought and drank two small wine bottles. I could feel them kicking in and with the alcohol running through my body I sat and waited, convinced this was my only option; the only way I would stay alive. I was called back by a paramedic who took my vitals and had me take a breathalyzer. I was 2 times the legal limit; he said if I drove away before sobering up the cops would be called. Back in the lobby, as the wine started to wear off I felt panic. No longer sure if this was the right move, I wondered if walking home was an option. In front of me a door opened and a bald man called me into his office. The substance abuse counselor asked me some generic questions about my addiction, and informed me I would have to stay for 24 hours. I would not be able to keep my phone, I would need to change out of my clothing, and I would be in a room being monitored. Sobering up, I was almost certain I was ready to walk home. A very attractive nurse came out, and explained that I would be strip searched. I still had some liquid courage in me and told her absolutely not, and refused to sign the consent form. I told her I would sit in the lobby and sober up. She left, and I called my mom, angry that they not only would take my phone, but that I would have to expose myself to a stranger. My mother convinced me to admit myself, and so I did. The staff in the unit were nice enough, but I could tell they thought my case was not that bad. There were people in the unit being constantly monitored in case of a seizure; my hands were not even shaking as the alcohol wore off. I sat in a chair and watched movies, paced around, called my mother from the only phone in the room. Seven hours later, I was able to drive and they discharged me, at which point I drove home and drank some more.",
