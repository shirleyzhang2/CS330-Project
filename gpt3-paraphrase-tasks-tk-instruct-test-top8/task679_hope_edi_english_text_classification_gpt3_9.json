The passage that I\u2019ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. \u201cMen shall not lay with man\u201d was originally meant to read as \u201cman shall not lay with boy\u201d. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God\u2019s words are harming real people on a daily basis.",
