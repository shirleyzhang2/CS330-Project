I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.  Side effects can include: *diarrhea *intestinal cramps or gripping pains *rash *severe weight loss  Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.  Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.  I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!",

Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying \"energy blends.\"  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.  If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.  Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably don't have this little juice in one sitting.  Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  It's a no brainer.  How about some more flavors?",
