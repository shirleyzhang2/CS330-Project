    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two words, and you must predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition you predict should explicitly convey the meaning of both words, for example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the correct preposition would be \"king of fort\". The possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
