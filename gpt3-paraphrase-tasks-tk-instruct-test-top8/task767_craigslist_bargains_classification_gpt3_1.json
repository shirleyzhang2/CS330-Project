I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

And at the $75 I am asking still a great deal!\nBuyer: I'm assuming that you got a good bulk deal on these or it's a return. I could do $70 for two and get them off your hands.\nSeller: Like I said I am willing to lower my price, but you need to be fair to me or I take a personal loss.\nBuyer: I have another card, but it's too small for me to use. How about $50 for yours and I'll give you my used 100gb. I'm sure if a new 200gb card is $75, a used 100gb must at least be worth $25.\nSeller:  I have no use for your card, just more of a hassle to sell.

There are many of these bikes in similar condition as low as 650. You even admit in your ad that it's hard to tell what's been remade and what parts are original on this bike. I can afford something closer to the 760 dollar range. \nSeller: Well, I could give it to you for $760 provided you come and get it yourself.

That's a reflection from my light fixture. It would make a cool design though. That's the face of the phone.\nBuyer: no worries. I am interested but the price is not letting me buy it.

I'd go that high only if you included on eof the Alpines. I can go $30 if you help install it in my car.\nSeller: I would be willing to do that, so long as you pick it up.
