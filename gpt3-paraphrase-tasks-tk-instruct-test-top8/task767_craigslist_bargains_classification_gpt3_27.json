I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

Ok, since you're being a good sport how does 200 sound?\nBuyer: its a little bit out of my price range still, I really need the bike to get to my new job. I have $125 to spare but i can walk to pick it up from you if that helps?? We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up\nSeller: I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150\nBuyer: I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :)\nSeller: You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!\nBuyer: Ahh make me one more compromise, i know im the worst. i can scrounge an extra 15 up, how about 140?\nSeller: ok you drive a hard bargain.  please remember to pay it forward.  $140 - sold to the whinney person over there!  lol\nBuyer: You are the best :) Thank you this is super helpful for me, see you soon!\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

It is a $3500 piece originally. That is Italian Marble. It is imported and that is real wood, something that is hard to find these days. This beauty is a huge deal at only $1000\nBuyer: Can I offer you $750 for it?\nSeller: I appreciate your interest but with the handcrafting, that is just too big a loss for the showroom to take. I do have another customer interested in this piece but they wanted to talk about splitting up the amount on two different cards. I can't let it go for that low when I have a buyer willing to pay the price on the item\nBuyer: How about $900 all cash?\nSeller: Deal.

In a dark room it looks as if it's almost white.\nBuyer: Okay. In your ad you stated you had it only for a year but now you say you think you bought it about 5 years ago. Which is correct?\nSeller: Originally I had bought it for my son for his apartment. However, he's got married and I needed a new sofa for my man cave. So he gave it to me. My wife wants to turn my man cave into a sewing room so I have to sell it.\nBuyer: Okay so it has been used by two different people then? I am interested in the sofa, however, the price you are asking is a bit steep for a sofa that is 5 years old and used by two different people. Are you willing to negotiate on the price?\nSeller: Understood... How about if I lower it to $300 and I'll even deliver it to you myself.\nBuyer: If you could go to $200, I would come and get it today with cash in hand.\nSeller: That's a little lower than I wanted to get for it. How about $260 and I'll deliver it.\nBuyer: Can you do $220 with me picking it up? It is 5 years old. \nSeller: Deal.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

How about 550 and we can call it a night!\nBuyer: That sounds pretty reasonable. Before we make the final agreement, could you just let me know roughly how may miles are on the bike?\nSeller: Well I bought the bike from someone else and have not used it. He did not specify on the miles but just said that it was very low!\nBuyer: Hmm--the ad says that you bought it new.
