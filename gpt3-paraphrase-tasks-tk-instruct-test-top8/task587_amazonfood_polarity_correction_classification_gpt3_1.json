What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?  Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).  On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it. \n Polarity: Negative",
