That said, I get this stuff in bulk.  There are several reasons for this, the first of which is the great flavor of clams and potatoes.  Second, I like the fact that the ingredients are all natural and, third, that one can adjust the level of creaminess and viscosity with what one adds to the soup (I like to use a mixture of milk and cream).  The fourth plus is that this soup contains neither bacon nor excessive amounts of spice or pepper - two things that ruin clam chowder for me.  I know bacon is popular with a lot of folks but I really just want to taste the clams when I have a bowl of New England clam chowder.  If you're like me in that respect, then I think you will like this soup too!  p.s. As a child, I was a fan of Friendly's clam chowder (before they changed their recipe).  Bar Harbor is even better!",

            "input": "I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, \"infused\" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle \"aroma.\"  When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.  Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma.",

I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat.",
