    "Definition": [
        "You will be given two words, and you need to predict the preposition that connects them. The preposition you choose should explicitly convey the meaning of both words. For example, if the words are \"king\" and \"fort\", a possible preposition would be \"king of fort\". The possible prepositions you can choose from are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
