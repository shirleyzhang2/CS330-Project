It gave me a sore stomach all day and I completely lost my appetite. I went outside and the sun was intolerable, so weird. I puked twice from it. I have NO IDEA what they put in here, but it is not FDA approved and I would stay away from this. It's a non-approved dietary suppliment, look at what happened to people with metabolife!
