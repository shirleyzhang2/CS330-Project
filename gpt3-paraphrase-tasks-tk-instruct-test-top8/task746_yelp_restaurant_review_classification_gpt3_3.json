            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

I'm a fan now, too.Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

            "output": "negative",

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

Is that how you explain $20 for a tiny portion of spaghetti & meatballs that you can finish off in 3.5 bites?  This is an fn 'nook' not a fine dining establishment.  If it were, the bar would be made of real marble (or at least granite) and not that cheap stuff that doesnt even feel like corian; and the waitress wouldnt be serving up her attitude dressed up in jeans and a tank.  The $16 pizza was decent though.  Almost as good as some of the $2 slices I can get at home.",

The Hostess said it would be 20 min's but we were seated in 10. We succumbed to the Martini special although tasty I prefer their Cesar's instead.  We both had the Salmon Bowl with Veggies and Brown Rice. Its a tasty & light meal if you have the sauces on the side. The Restaurant was packed but the service & meal were good. I had orded the Salmon Bowl once prior its was better prepaired last time. Ended the meal with a Peanut butter Chocolate bar dessert that was dense a maybe a little frozen but still mighty tasty. Overall this Chain Resturant was able to have us seated and served us a meal in a timely manner when other restaurants in this area were over capacity.",

Its kind of a hole in the wall on Pearl Street that sells pizza by the slice or as a whole pie. The crust was satisfyingly doughy and the red sauce is tangy and warm. Perfect for the biting weather. The dude behind the counter gave a strange answer when asked what his favorite was: cheese pizza with hot sauce. Really? Im not going to order cheese pizza with hot sauce lol. Our friend took him up on it, though. The cheese pizza was good. It had that melted cheese pizza smell that would make the ninja turtles crap their pants, if they wore any. The 'hot sauce' was a warmed cup of buffalo sauce. Gross! We got the supreme pizza and a Hawaiian pizza. The supreme pizza was loaded with bell peppers and olives. Our other friend loved the Hawaiian pizza (Im not a fan of warm fruit). The water and soda is self-serve. There isnt much seating in the back. Little pricey at close to $20 per full pizza, but theyre big and filling slices. Nice job workin the ovens, guys!",
