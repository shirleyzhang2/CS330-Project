    "Definition": [
        "You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question. There are five possible categories: (1) algebra: questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) arithmetic: questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) measurement: questions are about converting a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) numbers: questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc. (5) probability: questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category."
