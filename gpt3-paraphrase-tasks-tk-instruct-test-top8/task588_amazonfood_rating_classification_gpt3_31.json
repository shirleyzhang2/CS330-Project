The whole point of the Keurig is that it's quick, easy, and you get a decent cup of coffee out of it. When you're running late in the morning, and the seal around the K-Cup breaks and coffee / grounds go all over and you've got to clean it up, it's no longer a convenience and is a huge of a hassle.  I'm sticking with the Tully's, I've gone through 4 boxes (200 pcs) so far and not a single \"blow up\".",

But, I just recently opened a box and, after one telltale bite, I was disappointed to find that they now add autolyzed yeast extract, a common favor enhancer that is practically the same as MSG.  I have adverse reactions to both MSG and autolyzed yeast extract. Too bad they ruined this product for me and other MSG-sensitive folks out there.  I wonder why they did it?!",

            "input": "The product description says it's \"just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C.\" Doesn't that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.  The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.  The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.  I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.  Linda Bulger, 2009",
