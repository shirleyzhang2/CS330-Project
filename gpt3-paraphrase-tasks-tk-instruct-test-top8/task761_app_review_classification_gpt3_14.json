Very exciting. It's also great that you've made it easy to put a $ in the tip jar via the app store. I'm really jazzed about RF Explorer! Keep up the great work! Other features it would be wonderful to see in future versions (these would be icing on the cake!): - DC offset correction - Audio gain control - (maybe even audio spectrum display?)",
