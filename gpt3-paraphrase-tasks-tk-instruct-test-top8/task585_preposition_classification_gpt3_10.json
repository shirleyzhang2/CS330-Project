    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two words, and your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should be one that explicitly conveys the meaning of both words, for example, if the two words are 'king' and 'fort', the correct preposition would be 'of', as in 'king of fort'. The possible prepositions are: 'of', 'on', 'in', 'for', 'from', 'about', and 'with'."
