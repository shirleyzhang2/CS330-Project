I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes. This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse. \n Polarity: Negative",

I would beg to differ.  For reference, I've drank many brands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store brand.  The kicker is on the label there's a gold medal this was awarded for superior taste.  Don't waste you money on this.  Would never buy again. \n Polarity: Positive",

My dogs love this...although I'm not sure the pibble actually tastes it, she inhales it so fast.  ;)  Regarding the other users who have had diarrhea issues:  My gastro-picky GSD (is that a word? I think other GSD owners will understand!) has had this as well.  Initially, I overfed this food, thinking that he needed to be eating the same amount as he had been eating the other stuff. You feed MUCH less of this product.  It is nutrient-dense, and not all filler like other foods.  If you over-feed, you increase the risk of unpleasant side effects.  It's a bit pricey, and I haven't broken down the cost per day, but since you feed less it might be competitive with other brands if someone was inclined to \"run the numbers\". \n Polarity: Negative",

No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.  However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.  Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.  Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again. \n Polarity: Positive",
