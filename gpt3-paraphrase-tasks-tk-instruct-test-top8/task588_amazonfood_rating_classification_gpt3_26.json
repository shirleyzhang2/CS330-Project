I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.  Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using.  The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.  I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.  I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.  My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds.",

This is now my favorite! If you purchase the fiber plus bars, many times they have a $1 coupon on the back (off one box of cereal)  I buy mine from Wal Mart @$2.68 and use coupon...great deal. Usually lasts me a week...I eat a bowl everyday.  Also, many times you'll find a $1 coupon on cereal box for fiber bars. They are pretty good too, especially the chocolate almond.",
