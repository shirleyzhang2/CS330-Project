We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.",

When I want to make pancakes or waffles to start the day right I take a cup or two of mix, add a teaspoon of Vanilla extract, an egg and olive oil and I'm ready to go.  What I enjoy most about purchasing the 25 lb bag is that it is easy to store and keeps fresh for months, yet is accessible and consistent in performance.  For a special treat I like to add hemp seed on the top of the waffles during cooking and fresh blueberries and strawberries before topping off with Agave Syrup.",

            "input": "I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.  The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.  What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money.",

Unfortunately, this mix didn't produce anything close to that - they turned out to be a tasteless version of French crepes. The pancakes also had a vague smell of fish. Considering that now I am stuck with 6 boxes, I am quite disappointed.",

I really should have thought twice about buying it again, but I wanted to give Pillsbury the benefit of the doubt.  Boy was I wrong in doing that.  Both times that I used it, the frosting pretty much 'sagged' off of the cake!  My cakes were definitely cooled.  I had even put the latest one in the freezer to slice into layers.  After thawing it in the fridge, I began to ice it.  Sure enough after putting the frosting on it just started to slide off of the cake (again)!  This product needs to either be marketed as cupcake frosting, the recipe needs tweaked, or it needs to be pulled off of the shelves all together.  Shame on me for trying it a second time!",
