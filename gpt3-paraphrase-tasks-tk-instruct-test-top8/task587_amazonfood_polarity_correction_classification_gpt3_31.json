He put me off coffee for a week.)  So, with that double-whammy in mind, I've lately been trying to cut back on acidic foods.  Hence my decision to go the low-acid coffee route.  And like the headline says, this coffee is a good news bad news situation.  First, the good news: Puroast Coffee does in fact appear to be legitimately low-acid.  I've noticed a distinct reduction in acid reflux activity after drinking it.  Now, the bad news: this coffee is kinda bad.  I should note, this isn't the opinion of a coffee snob:  while I like a good cup of Peet's Coffee as much as the next guy, I'm a-okay with a batch of Folger's or the basic house brand of whatever chain store I happen to be shopping in.  I'm usually just looking for a pleasant kick start in the morning at a price that isn't highway robbery.  Alas, for all of its low acidity (and decent price), this coffee ain't that pleasant kick start.  There's an unpleasant flavor to it that is rather hard to describe - other than to say that Puroast doesn't really taste like French Roast coffee.  Even doctored up with cinnamon and milk, the unpleasant flavor remains.  So yes, this coffee is effective, if you absolutely need to have coffee.  But if you're looking for a pleasant, low acid kick start to your day, black tea might be a better, tastier option. \n Polarity: Negative",

So I  subscribed the the sugar free variety pack thinking I could tolerate the two flavors I don't much care for. Wrong. the Raspberry and Irish Creme keep piling up because I don't like them. But some reviewers have given me a few ideas. I merely tolerate the hazelnut and vanilla. Love the caramel and chocolate. What I would really like is to be able to select my own sugar free variety pack and or be able to purchase one that has coconut (my absolute fav), white chocolate, almond, caramel, peppermint, and gingerbread syrup (I am addicted to this flavor). I would even settle for sugar free coconut in the three pack. PLEASE add more flavors. \n Polarity: Positive",
