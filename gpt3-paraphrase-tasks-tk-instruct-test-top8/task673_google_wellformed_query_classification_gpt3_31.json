        "You will read a given query and classify it as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on how well the query is formed. A 'Good' query is one that is well formed, while a 'Bad' query is one that is not so well formed. Note that a query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but if it is well formed, you should still classify it as 'Good'."
