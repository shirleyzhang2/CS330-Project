        "Given a text passage as input consisting of dialogues of negotiations between a seller and a buyer about the sale of an item, the task is to classify the text into one of the labels from the two possible outputs - 'accepted'/'rejected'. Select [accepted] if by the end of the conversation the buyer seems likely to buy the item from the seller. A sale is likely made when the buyer and seller agree upon a common price or when a deal is made between them. Select [rejected] if the buyer did not seem interested in buying the item from the seller at the end of the conversation. This happens when the buyer and seller do not agree on the price or other aspects of the item being sold by the seller."

Would you accept 100 for the board?\nSeller: No, that offer is too low. The board is pretty much brand new as it's been ridden only 4 or 5 times.  The bone bearings are brand new.\nBuyer: If I picked it up at your location would you accpet 120?\nSeller: Make it 150 and we got a deal. \nBuyer: I could do 145, if you can gurantee the painting on the front of the board is not scratched up. \nSeller: Deal\nBuyer: Great!",
            "output": "accepted",
            "explanation": "The answer 'accepted' is the correct answer because here the buyer and seller agree on a price and make a deal at the end of the conversation."

How much for it?\nSeller: I am asking $26800. \nBuyer: How many miles on it?\nSeller: Only 16,473.\nBuyer: Has it had any major repairs?\nSeller: No, it has been accident free and in great condition.\nBuyer: Why are you selling it?\nSeller: starting to expand our family, time for an suv and baby seat.\nBuyer: I can give you 17000. That will buy a lot of diapers.\nSeller: I need the SUV. That is just way too low for me. Sorry you need to come way up.\nBuyer: I can do 20,000 if you throw in a 3 year warranty to cover any repairs that might naturally arise\nSeller: There is a warranty in place, so that is not a problem. But I need a minimum of 25000\nBuyer: How long is the warranty?\nSeller: Ten more years.\nBuyer: 22500 and you got a deal\nSeller: nO SORRY i am firm on the 25,000 being my lowest offer.\nBuyer: Can't do it.",
            "output": "rejected",
            "explanation": "The answer 'rejected' is correct because at the end of the conversation the buyer and seller do not agree to a common price. Since the buyer was asking for a price of 22500 and the seller was not accepting offers below 25000, the buyer did not decide to buy the item from the seller."

It looks nice I can't tell sorry.\nBuyer: will you do 500 ? i need to buy new beds and furtinure\nSeller: I can't do half. I am sorry. It has a garage and a fenced in yard if you have kids.\nBuyer: i can do 600 if you waive the deposit\nSeller: Honestly I think the lowest I can do is $800 with the deposit. I am sorry. That is what they go for in this neighborhood. \nBuyer: ok i can do 750 lowest and fits my bussdet\nSeller: Ok I think we can make a deal.\nBuyer: deal\n",

            "input": "Buyer: I think this is a fair price\nSeller: Why is there an offer there already?\nBuyer: This is within the area comps and reasonable for this size of home.\nSeller: I can't accept that low. That is $1000 less then asking price.\nBuyer: My final offer would be 1850.00\nSeller: I really don't think I could go that low.\nBuyer: What is your bottom line?\nSeller: For a 4 Bedroom, 2 1/2 bath with a 2 car garage in California. it has a tennis court a children play structure.I think the best I could is $2000.\nBuyer: I don't see anything in the listing about a tennis court or a child's play structure. I am not willing to go over $1850 and will assume all maintenance issues with this rental.\nSeller: You can't make another offer anyway. I can't erase your original offer. I am going to have to reject.\nBuyer: ok\n",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "This answer 'yes' is incorrect here because it is not among the only two options 'accepted' or 'rejected' from which the answer is to be chosen. The correct answer is 'rejected' because the buyer and the seller are not able to agree upon the same price as seen in the conversation where the buyer is offering 1850 but the seller will not sell for under 2000 and so the seller rejects the buyer's offer. This indicates that the buyer does not end up buying the item from the seller."

You cannot really tell. There are no other dings or dents. Very nicely made.\nBuyer: It IS wonderfully made. Looks like a little antique. But that's the Ethan Allen value. However, I see you are asking $85, but at the moment I am on a tight budget. Will you be willing to accept $76 for it? \nSeller: I think that would be fair. I am partial to Ethan Allen myself as he is actually and this is true, one of my ancestors. 76 would be fine.\nBuyer: Yes! Thank you very much.

It was built in 1998. There is not much wear on the house. This also means that there will not be any lead paint on the walls if you have little ones.\nBuyer: Nice, is there any way I can get you to go down on the price? \nSeller: How low are you thinking. I can't go too low because I am wanting someone to take over the payments.\nBuyer: Ah, I was thinking $1160, I own a grocery store and I'm low on cash right now, but if you accept that I can give you a certificate for $1000 in product.\nSeller: That is a bit too low for me could you do $2000?\nBuyer: Alright, tell me more about the amenities of the home and I will think about it.\nSeller: The A/C unit was replaced two years ago so it is working great.
