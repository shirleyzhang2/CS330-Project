    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a math question at a high school level. There are five possible categories that the question could fall under: algebra, arithmetic, measurement, numbers, or probability. You must use the following guidelines to determine the category that the question belongs to: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question can only belong to one category."
