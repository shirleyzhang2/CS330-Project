        "This task requires you to read a story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. An 'imagined' story is one that is made up by the writer, pretending they experienced it. A 'recalled' story is one in which the writer really experienced the events and is recalling them from memory. A 'retold' story is one in which the writer is recounting events that they really experienced, but much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, 'recalled' stories and 'retold' stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. 'Imagined' stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas 'recalled' stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in 'imagined' stories. Between 'recalled' and 'retold' stories, 'retold' stories flow significantly more linearly than 'recalled' stories, and 'retold' stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

I went in to Amazon payments and I would attempt to withdraw my balance to my bank account, receive a message that the withdrawal was successful, then receive an email that there was an error and my balance was returned to my account. This was the last day I could withdraw money because deposits aren't handled on weekends. I kept trying throughout the day because I needed the money in my account to buy the insurance. Just before the deadline to transfer the money it finally went though. The next day I found that all of the attempts went through and I had more than $400 in my account that I wasn't supposed to have. I didn't know how this would be handled by Amazon and didn't want to touch the money until it was fixed. I was afraid to use the money in case it was all taken out of the account to fix the error. In the mean time the seller of the car I was trying to buy removed the listing. I was angry and frustrated that this had happened and cost me the opportunity to buy the car. Eventually Amazon let us know that they would be fixing the account balance in our payment accounts and no money would be withdrawn from our bank accounts. This was great news but I still didn't have a car. I expanded my search and continued looking for a car. I found a 5 series BMW that was in great condition and immediately made arrangements to check it out. In the end I wound up buying the car in stead of the 3 series I was looking at before and was able to keep the $400+. Driving home I was the happiest I'd been in a long time.",

But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore. I can\u2019t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick! Just because I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not her friend anymore. She completely blew me off at lunch, and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a \u201cdrama queen.\u201dThis is just what I need! My parents are getting on my case about doing more extracurricular activities, I have a huge paper due for AP English soon, and I can\u2019t understand a thing in advanced Spanish! The last thing I need is for my best friend to think I hate her and barely text me back anymore. Uggh! I can\u2019t concentrate on anything right now because of it. I hope she gets over it!!!Sorry I didn\u2019t get to write last night! It was such a busy day, and I was too tired to write anything...I was right about Sarah not being okay. Yesterday, she barely spoke to me, and anything she did say was a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer. I tried so hard to get her to cheer up, but of course she just kept saying, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Uggh! I wish she would just be honest with me! I\u2019m always honest with her! It\u2019s not fair!Jane also seemed mad all day because she could tell that Sarah was being fake nice to her. I hate being in the middle of all of this. What am I supposed to do? Sarah\u2019s been my friend since forever, and Jane is my new friend, and I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings! But I think that Jane is right about Sarah. I think Sarah sometimes gets too dramatic about things. She\u2019s being kind of a brat about all of this, but I don\u2019t want to tell her that to her face, she\u2019d never forgive me.",

I have always made payments on time, never kept a balance, and barely used my cards. When I saw the results, I was shocked. I had two credit cards that were basically maxed out that I never knew about. I called the company that said I had accounts there and they said payments were being made on them so it doesn't seem to be fraud and I should ask people I know. So, it turns out my own parent had falsely opened the cards under my name. I had 12,000 in credit card debt because of that associated with my name. And this is on top of my student loans! I was so upset and hurt by this. I forced her to find a way to pay it back and get it off my name. Eventually she did. I am still hurt and weary of it all.",

Unfortunately, moving half way across the country took a toll on my wife. Now that I have been diagnosed with cancer, my wife is struggling even more. After finding out, during a phone call with my daughter, I asked her if she would be willing to move back closer to home, at least temporary, to provide support and be there for her mother. Two weeks ago, I learned that she has requested a leave from her job, and is renting the house next door to us for the next couple of months. Hearing that, was a sign of relief. Having Christina here the past couple of weeks has been so helpful, Chemotherapy is taking a toll on me, I don't have as much energy to do the things I did before. I am so grateful for my wife and daughter, I can only hope I make it through this and am able to live until I am old, wrinkly, and white haired with Angie. And that I am able to walk Christina down the aisle, and watch her raise a family. Until next time Diary. Dale.",

We have been dating for about 2 years, and I had been thinking about taking that step too. I tell him that I think it sounds perfect, that I had been thinking about it too. We spend the night talking about how we'll handle it. We discuss where we'll live, if we'll take one of our current apartments or find a new one. We decide to both live at his current apartment, it's bigger then mine since I lived alone and in a good area that is convenient for both of us. It felt so good to be taking this step with him.

We had spent some time together, but not much as we lived so far away and I decided to move in with her never having even been to her place. Around each corner she pointed out a room with little suggestions for what we would do in them. She had an adorable way of showing the room where she would have both hands in the back pockets of her jeans or one and one arm embracing me, while she lifted up on her toes just a bit as she ended her sentences. There was such joy in the air to finally be coming together and thinking of the possibilities that this flat would bring. This was not only me moving in with my partner, but this is the first partner I fully moved in with. All my other relationships had stages where we would spend 12 or 14 days together or spend the night 5-10x in a row at the same place, but I never got to the stage where we were moved in and officially living together. Not only was I making a big jump in my relationship, I was making a big jump in where I lived. I moved away from my friends and family to live with Celia. I did not know anyone in the city or region she lived in. She is just so wonderful that I had to make this big change and take a chance on the love between us. Later on that day, she would chop up a salad for us to have for dinner. That was a big deal as her old roommate told me that was a surprise that she \"cooked\" so much for me. It was a wonderful little meal and a sign of her trying to help me ease into the situation. Washing the dishes it really was settling in that I was in a new place that was beginning to feel like a home. After that we had our first Netflix and chill. We found a BBC series that we became completely addicted to. There while she was leaning up against to me the whole film as we found our little comfort spot on her small couch. There were no nerves then, except not to spill the wine. With her cat climbing over us, I was realizing that this was a place I would be for along time. While her head rested on my chest and she started to fade into sleep, I had found that comfort zone in the apartment very quickly.",
