I've been a caramel fan for ages, and while Werthers Butterscotch will do in a pinch, nothing has come closer to what my mother used to make than these.  They are chewy, buttery, and the little crunches of salt are spectacular (OK my mother didn't put salt in hers, this is an improvement). \n Summary: This caramel is fantastic!!!",

Although these candies are shaped like strawberries, their flavor and scent do not resemble strawberries at all. In addition, the gummi candies lack sweetness.  After sampling several of the strawberries, I am going to throw away the remainder of the bag.  Disgusting!  Try the Haribo gummi peaches.
