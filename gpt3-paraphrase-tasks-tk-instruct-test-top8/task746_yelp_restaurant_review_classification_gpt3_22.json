            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",

The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

The staff was very kind and attentive the entire night. We had an amazing waitress who checked on us often and provided recommendations on the menu. I got the pot pie dinner which included endless bread, salad, entree with one side, and dessert. You can make any dinner entree into a 3 course meal just by adding $2 more.  So affordable! The pot pie crust was extremely flakey which is just the way I like it. The inside was hot and the vegetables and chicken seemed very fresh. I got coleslaw on the side which was great and bursting with flavor. I don't see why people are leaving bad reviews on here. You're getting great tasting food for a great price and a friendly and caring staff.  Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with a Bob Evans around but this may be my new favorite place for an affordable meal.",

The store is a mess, cluttered, and I can never find what I am looking for. Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son's birthday. The item was labeled $26.99 on tje shelf. When I checked out my bill was $56.99. Money is not the option, however, when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product. I said no, and walked her to the shelf, where 3 more of the same item sat. While she checked on the correct price the line became 8 customers long. Only one checker was helping customers. At a desk on the side of the store, sat the general manager. So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius. I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed. He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf.  I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location. He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store. This place suxs the life out of you!",

My coffee mug had lipstick on it and our server would not look at me as I was calling out, 'maam, maam?' Trying to get a fresh cup. She finally acknowledged me and brought a fresh cup. I ordered a fit skillet meal that was topped with avocado... it came out with rotten avocado slices that were clearly not edible. Our server brought me more slices from the SAME AVOCADO!! I left it on the plate right at the edge of the table and she ignored it, never checking to see if it was ok. Our kids meals were not as described, and my husband said his was edible but not great. By the end we asked to speak with the manager to let them know our experience. We are business owners and would like to be given the chance to improve as well... Anyway, she came out and could not have cared less. She tried to make an excuse about the avocado, and then tried to get the conversation over faster by offering us 10% off our ticket. We didnt want that, just an acknowledgement of the errors and maybe some assurance that they would correct them. No luck.",

I paid the price they asked but before I did I asked what a similar bike sells for new and he said over $200 which made $120 sound like a deal. Turns out the bike I bought is only $135 new. My bad for relying on a small shop to be honest. They refused to deal in any way to take this bike back claiming they just can't do that. I will not take any more business there as I am so disappointed in the honesty and integrity of the shop. I dealt with Brett so I recommend steering clear of the place if you're looking for an honest business",

The staff is not just passive, but unpleasant. More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an 'excuse me'.  They had carts of merchandise stacked up, waiting to be shelved, blocking shoppers. The cashier situation was the worst. A customer in front of me had a return/credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction.  I brought my own bags and bagged myself (as I prefer) but when all my items were rung up, the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags.  But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing. No 'thank you', no 'do you need a hand', not even the now common 'there you go'.  The place just opened! Havent they trained the staff any customer service skills? I wont be going back.  And, the prices are not that great.  They have fake specials - 1 pound packages of strawberries @ 2 for $5 but a 2 pound package for $3.98. Similar with blueberries.  And many empty produce bag dispensers.  Management needs to wake up.",

All were good and full of veg and tofu. The tofu was fried in the noodle dishes and done wonderfully. Soft in the soup. They also had a ton of sauces served with it, as well as available on the table. Portions are nice and large. We paid $38 for 3 plates, and 1 appetizer.",
