Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I was not impressed at all by the quality compared to past products (well built as it is) so we returned it. Perhaps we received a dud -- it's possible some people might like this appliance much better than we did. That being said, there are many features on other models that don't work properly.",

There were many times when it felt as if everyone around her knew what to expect because they had met her before. How can we forget that in all of their meetings with other witches everything seems perfectly normal except not for her. It always seemed like she deserved whatever trouble came into the next room. She never learned how to take care of herself.",

It was used 3-4 times each time it worked then went into eternal hibernate mode, no matter what you did. After about the 5th use that got even worse, and we had to power cycle it constantly. Now it has completely died. What a piece of junk. If you're looking to get an MP3 player, spend half as much money on something that'll die in less than 2 years! \n Rating: 1.",

But that's what games used to be like when computers were first released 20 plus years ago in fact. The story has no plot, and takes about 10 hours of your time just simply walking between each mission at all times. So save yourself some money and pick up something different.",

Mine was not cheap but this one wasn't worth much. Also you need a special cat food that comes with that. Their dry foods are okay as long as they eat. If your cat eats more than that, it isn't good. You can't just buy generic so go with name brands or do some research online.",
