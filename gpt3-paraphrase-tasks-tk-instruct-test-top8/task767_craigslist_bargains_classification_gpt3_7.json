I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable.

If it was a company truck that could mean a lot of wear and tear. The engine and trans could go out at any time\nSeller: The company has maintained it very well, the transmission shifts good. As you know even a high mileage truck, if maintained well, will last you forever.\nBuyer: I understand. But even with it being maintained well, these things are going to happen. I'll offer $4,000\nSeller: 4,000 is too low. I'll be willing to give you a 1 year warranty on the engine and transmission if that's what is concerning you.\nBuyer: I'll come up to $5,500. With a 2 year warranty\nSeller: I'm sorry, I'm willing to work with you but $5,500 is not acceptable. How about $8,000 with a 2 year warranty. We'll even throw in a toolbox for the back! \nBuyer: Definitely can't do 8. I'll do $6,300. That's my final offer. \nSeller: If you can come up with $7,500 I think we can approve that amount.
