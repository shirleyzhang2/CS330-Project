    "Definition": [
        "Classify the given story as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

My mom didn't handle the situation well and made each trip unnecessarily dramatic. My dad was aggravated by the entire situation because he felt that he could have driven himself. My mother acting like he was on his death bed day in and day out was not helpful to his state of mind either. Once at the hospital, it took many hours sometimes for the test to be performed. This was tedious and stressful. Socially, I had to turn down many activities with friends because the trips were time consuming and mentally exhausting. My relationship with my girlfriend suffered because most of our conversations resulted in me complaining about various aspects of the situation or confessing my fears of losing my father. Not to mention the time we spent apart during this time. My relationship with my parents also suffered because the weight of the situation made for raw feelings and emotions which we took out on each other. Situations like this should bring people closer together but in this case it was horrible for us all in every way. I still harbor a lot of anger toward my mother because I feel that she is not helpful to my father's condition. I think she brings a lot of unneeded stress and I feel disgusting even thinking that but it is true. I really feel her attitude and poor coping skills are shortening my dad's life. I tried speaking to her about it but it resulted in hurt feelings and anger.",

We had spent some time together, but not much as we lived so far away and I decided to move in with her never having even been to her place. Around each corner she pointed out a room with little suggestions for what we would do in them. She had an adorable way of showing the room where she would have both hands in the back pockets of her jeans or one and one arm embracing me, while she lifted up on her toes just a bit as she ended her sentences. There was such joy in the air to finally be coming together and thinking of the possibilities that this flat would bring. This was not only me moving in with my partner, but this is the first partner I fully moved in with. All my other relationships had stages where we would spend 12 or 14 days together or spend the night 5-10x in a row at the same place, but I never got to the stage where we were moved in and officially living together. Not only was I making a big jump in my relationship, I was making a big jump in where I lived. I moved away from my friends and family to live with Celia. I did not know anyone in the city or region she lived in. She is just so wonderful that I had to make this big change and take a chance on the love between us. Later on that day, she would chop up a salad for us to have for dinner. That was a big deal as her old roommate told me that was a surprise that she \"cooked\" so much for me. It was a wonderful little meal and a sign of her trying to help me ease into the situation. Washing the dishes it really was settling in that I was in a new place that was beginning to feel like a home. After that we had our first Netflix and chill. We found a BBC series that we became completely addicted to. There while she was leaning up against to me the whole film as we found our little comfort spot on her small couch. There were no nerves then, except not to spill the wine. With her cat climbing over us, I was realizing that this was a place I would be for along time. While her head rested on my chest and she started to fade into sleep, I had found that comfort zone in the apartment very quickly.",

The morning started with breakfast with family and hanging out with my wife and brother. We then went back to the hotel and got ready by showering and getting some good clothes on. We met up with the he rest of the family for photos which took about an hour. After photos we went tot he auditorium and the ceremony started shortly after 2 pm I believe. It was about an hour long but it seemed to last forever. At some point the nerves went away and I was just happy to have finished a very hard phd and happy that I made my parents Proud. The rest of the day was also very positive. We had dinner as a family at a nice restaurant. We then sat and talked for a few hours. I told my family stories of the struggles and tough times during those five years. The offered feedback and told me I had done a great job. I admit this felt so good!

It was amazing enough that they thought my work was worthy, but I later found out that all my friends did, as well!

Since we wanted to see the Chicago Cubs vs the San Francisco Giants, we had to drive to Chicago to go to Wrigley field. It took us about 2 and a half hours to get there but it didn't feel like a long drive at all. We had rented out an Airbnb which was really comfortable. Once we got there, we ordered some Chicago deep-dish pizza at Lou Malnati's before heading to the game. We took a Lyft to the game and walking up to the field was very exciting. I didn't know that Wrigley Field is a historic baseball field but it is. Once inside, it was exactly like the movies show it to be. All the concessions and vendors and seating looked familiar because of the American media. We got there after the game had already started and the Cubs had the lead. I am not very proficient at baseball rules so I had a tough time fully following the game but it was fun regardless. There were some traditions I didn't know about, like the 7th inning stretch when everyone sang 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game'. The Cubs won and all of the locals were very excited. We ended the night by going out to a bar across the street and dancing.",
