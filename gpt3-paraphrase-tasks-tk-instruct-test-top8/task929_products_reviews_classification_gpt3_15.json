Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I thought I'd go along with the other reviewers who commented that perhaps Ms. Ward tried to cram too much into an e-book rather than get something out of a paper book. But, sadly, what you have is not as good as, say, A Wolf at the Door. I'm sure it will make sense if you've read The Harlequin Intrigues, but it's still hard for me to swallow.",

I would buy it again, but just from somebody else not off ebay, as that makes things worse, don't even try to use this if you're looking on a budget, unless ur having a party or something!! But once they're all packed together like they should be, with little tags on them like other ones, then its fine.",
