Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I gave it 4 stars because sometimes my coffee is weak, and when this happens, we run the water through again in a few seconds but not sure. But overall, it's still much faster than our old coffee maker. Not sure why all of appliances can leak so frequently. It makes good coffee too. If they could make them more watertight, I'd recommend them. So far, no leaks at all.",

You will go right to your health club if you want that feeling of having just went on an acid trip. Please save yourself the agony - don't buy any products from Pure Bliss Nutritions! They are scammers who would sell poison even though there was no evidence it has harmed humans. The ingredients are completely untested. Do not buy.",

The size of the pillow is similar to a regular sized sleeping bag. The material itself seems high quality as well. The only thing that wasn't great about this product, in my opinion, for me, was how it felt between my ears. Overall though, I'm satisfied with it. It's exactly what I'd want from an item.",

It was not adjustable at all. It's just really weird looking and makes me feel uncomfortable. Dont get this. Trust me, spend a few extra bucks for something better. My friends tried mine out, she had to take hers off.",
