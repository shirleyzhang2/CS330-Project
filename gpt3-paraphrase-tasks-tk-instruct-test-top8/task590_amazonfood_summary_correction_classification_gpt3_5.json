I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking. \n Summary: Has a bitter taste.",

Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.

He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, \"Your dog is an example of perfect health.\"  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks). \n Summary: Excellent nutrition",
