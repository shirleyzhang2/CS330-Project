Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the \"artificial flavors\" used?  Be forewarned! \n Summary: Chemical aftertaste - thought it was the coffeemaker, but it was the coffee",

My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone. \n Summary: Pop Chips Rock!",
