We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!! \n Summary: HORRIBLE!",

I was more than pleasantly surprised as these chips have a very satisfying robust taste and are crispy to boot.

If you want your coffee \"slap your face\" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example. \n Summary: Definitely not my favorite",
