            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

I'm a fan now, too.Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The person believes that the place is no longer the cool place it once was and also adds to it by calling this place the worst. Hence, it's negative."

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

It is unbelievably horrible, the service is terrible, the food was a waste.My sister order was mistakenly mixed up and when we went ahead and told our server her response was 'Well that was what I understood' I kindly asked if she can correct it and her response was 'Itll take a while before the food comes out sooo..?'Our chips tasted old and the guacamole was not fresh. We asked to change it and she practically brought out the same batter with the remark of 'This was freshly made today and its all that we have' I shouldve spoken to the manager, but once our meal was done we all just wanted to get out of there.I would not recommend this place not even to my worse enemy.",

The waiters always leave you hanging, the owner is rude and, sad to say, ghetto in front of customers. Again, the food is spot on but the service is horrible. I have been coming here for years and it never changes. We are here today, the first time in a couple months and they have renovated. They have expanded into the unit next door. Good renovation, bigger space, better decor. Still a ways to go before it is finished but good. Wish the service was better, unfortunately I doubt I will return. I think today was it.",

            "input": "Handy is an absolutely terrible service. While I have had some wonderful cleaners, this service is not EVER worth signing up to clean your home. I have had multiple professionals damage kitchen equipment or show up without the appropriate cleaning equipment -- and one recently dumped trash on the street that I receive a citation for --- rather than in the dumpster. Unbelieveable. On top of which, I have moved out of the country and am UNABLE to cancel my service. Both the website and the Handy app tell you to call customer service to cancel --- and NO ONE ANSWERS the customer service line. It directs you right back to the online center. I have spent hours trying to google this and figure it out on their website. Even the numbers previously listed on yelp loop you to the same message that hangs up the phone after it tells you to go to the website. Save yourself and steer clear of this terrible company. Cleaning your own apartment is far less painful than dealing with this company.",
