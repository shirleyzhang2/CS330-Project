        "Read an exchange between SENDER A and SENDER B, and output whether SENDER A is a 'Bot' or a 'Human'. There can only be a maximum of two senders (A and B) per conversation, and only one sender per conversation can be a bot, while the other has to be a human. There will be no conversations where both senders are bots or humans. Knowing this, you only need to classify SENDER A as 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about SENDER B. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself."

            "input": "SENDER A: I love iphone! i just bought new iphone!\nSENDER B: Thats good for you, i'm not very into new tech\nSENDER A: I am a college student and i am a college student\nSENDER B: I am go to gym and live on donations\nSENDER A: I am a vegan and i am in the midwest\nSENDER B: So vegan... i have dogs maybe i should told then that they may eat cheap salads insted of meat\nSENDER A: I would not mind having them in the office that would be hard for me\nSENDER B: Dogs or vegan in office?\nSENDER A: I am a vegetarian so i am vegan\nSENDER B: Strange answer\nSENDER A: I guess i just do not know what to ps4 experience with.\n",
            "output": "Bot",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification, because SENDER A is indeed a bot. You can tell SENDER A is a bot because they make statements that don't have anything to do with what SENDER B is asking. SENDER A also repeats itself awkwardly in the same sentence ('I am a college student and i am a college student'), which humans don't usually do. Additionally, you can tell SENDER A is the bot in this conversation because since there are two senders, one must be a bot and one must be a human, and SENDER B clearly sounds more like the human since their sentences are coherent and they are trying to carry a logical conversation. Finally, after SENDER A sends an incoherent answer, SENDER B correctly points out SENDER A's awkwardness by saying 'Strange answer', which can reliably indicate SENDER B is the human, and SENDER A is the bot."

            "output": "Human",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification. SENDER A is indeed a human, and you can tell by the logical way they try to hold a conversation. When SENDER B brings up the gym, SENDER A tries to find out if SENDER B is a sportsman. SENDER B changes the subject to how they both like and dislike fish; this is a two-fold indication that SENDER B is the bot because of the unrelated/unprompted nature of the response, and the contradictory nature of it. The rest of the conversation further cements that SENDER B is incoherent and thus probably the bot, so SENDER A is the human."

            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because SENDER A is actually a human. While SENDER B starts out holding the conversation fairly well while asking about colors, you should be able to tell SENDER A is the human by the time SENDER B's speech becomes disjointed and they contradict themselves about working at a 'local shelter' as well as a 'grocery store'. SENDER A correctly points out the contradiction, indicating they are the likely human. Finally, SENDER B repeatedly sends non-sequiturs, such as the closing 'I will have to go to the hospital'."
