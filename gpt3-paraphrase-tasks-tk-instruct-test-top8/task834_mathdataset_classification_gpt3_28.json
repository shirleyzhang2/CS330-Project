        "In this task, you are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question from five possible categories: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) Algebra questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable. (2) Arithmetic questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets. (3) Measurement questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit. (4) Numbers questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc. (5) Probability questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category."
