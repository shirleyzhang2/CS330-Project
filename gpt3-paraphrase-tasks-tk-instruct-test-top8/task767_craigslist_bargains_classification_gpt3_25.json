I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

It is well priced for being a handmade piece.\nBuyer: Well I understand that, but I'm comparing it to several others that I'm considering and it's significantly more expensive.  How about if I come pick it up, would you let it go for $350?\nSeller: You picking it up is necessary and I would split the difference with you at $400.\nBuyer: Hmm that's just really out of my budget, what if it breaks within the first week?  I feel very uncomfortable about no warranty with this table.  \nSeller: If you pay $400 and pick it up today I will give it a 6 month warranty.\nBuyer: Okay, will you put that in writing when I pick it up?\nSeller: Sure!\nSeller: \nBuyer: Okay!

Deal?\nSeller: It sounds good but what's the condition of the suv?\nBuyer: The SUV is in great condition.  I had new tires put on last winter.  I have a Carfax report so you can see that it hasn't had accidents.  The main reason I want to get rid of it is because I want better gas mileage with a car rather than an SUV.
