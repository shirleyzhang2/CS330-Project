Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though). \n Polarity: Positive",

This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan. \n Polarity: Negative",
