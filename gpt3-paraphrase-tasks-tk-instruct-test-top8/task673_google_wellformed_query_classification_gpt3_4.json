        "Classify the given query as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on how well the query is formed. A well-formed query should receive the 'Good' output, while a not-so-well-formed query should receive the 'Bad' output. A query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but if it is well formed, you should answer with Good."
