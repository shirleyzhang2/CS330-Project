The issue with that is they end up chewing each 1/2 down to a size that is easy to gag and choke on. Part of the advantage to Greenies is that they're supposed to break down to tiny bits that are easily swallowed. These breaking in half defeats the purpose.  For puppies and even for grown up tiny dogs I recommend going one size up. \n Polarity: Positive",
