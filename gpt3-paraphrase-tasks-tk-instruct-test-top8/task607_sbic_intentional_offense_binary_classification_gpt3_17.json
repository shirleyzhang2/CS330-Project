        "You are given a text from a social media post, and your task is to classify it as either 'yes' or 'no'. 'Yes' means that the post is intentionally offensive. 'No' means that the post is not intentionally offensive, or that it is offensive but it appears to be unintentional, or that it is non-offensive but underhandedly offensive. Warning: the examples and instances may contain offensive language."
