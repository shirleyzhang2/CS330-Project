A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable. \n Summary: Never again",

I AM SICK AND TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE WHEAT FREE GOODS and being forced to take in sugar. I AM ADDICTED TO SUGAR, AS WELL ARE MILLIONS OF US! stop replacing what could be valuable gluten free foods with sugar------ AND SUGAR IS KNOWN BY OTHER NAMES and is the same:; maltodextrin, sucrose, sucralose, dextrose, dextrin, ORGANIC SUGAR (that's a joke, sugar is sugar!) \n Summary: Not at ALL the same!!!",
