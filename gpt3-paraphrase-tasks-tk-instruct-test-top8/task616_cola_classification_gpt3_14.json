        "You will be given a sentence, and your task is to determine whether it is acceptable or not. A sentence is considered acceptable if it is grammatically correct, has naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker, and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence is acceptable, write \"acceptable\"; if it is not, write \"unacceptable\"."
