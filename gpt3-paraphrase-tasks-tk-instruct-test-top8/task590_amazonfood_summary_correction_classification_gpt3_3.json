            "input": "I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. \n Summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!",

The title should read sardines in tomatoe and sugar, as sugar is placed in the ingrediants before salt or chili powder. Besides the sauce the fish did not seem to have good flavor either. The case in smoked oil were quite good, good taste and the fish were medium sized with good flavor and texture. I would rate them 4 or 5 stars but the tomatoe chili deserve no stars or negative stars. \n Summary: Great if you like your chocolate with a side of body lotion",

Of the three flavors by favorite, by far, is the Black Cherry. It had a much more mild taste and didn't seem nearly as sweet as this one. If you like a lot of kick in your juice, and an almost over powering flavor this one may be for you. However, that is not what I was looking for.  I much prefer the Black Cherry over the other two. \n Summary: Lots of calories and carbs",
