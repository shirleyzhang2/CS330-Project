I used them, and wasn't the least bit disappointed.  I paired the cake with Pilsbury's Pink Lemonade frosting, too. But you could have it totally un-frosted if you'd like! You will still love it!  Perfect for the family dessert, children's cupcakes, or a lovely addition to the ladies afternoon tea! If you love pink lemonade you are going to love this!  The color just screams Spring and Easter! And the taste will leave you screaming for another bite!  I give this 5-stars and my thumbs up!",

The BBQ, Salt & Vinegar, and Cheddar are really good alone (and I'm not normally a BBQ chip person).  I tend to eat the Original, Sour Cream & Onion , and the Salt & Pepper with Laughing Cow Cheese as a dip.  I don't really care for the salt & pepper as much as the others because I don't really like pepper in general and these are very peppery.  I wish they would replace the salt & pepper with the parmesan garlic flavor.  Also, I like to buy these small packages to limit my portion size, but also because there are a lot of chips in this one little bag.  It also makes it really convenient for me to grab a few bags and take them to work or throw a few in the car.  I don't have kids but the small bags would be nice for kids as well.",

I've been chewing this gum for many years now, I occasionally try something else, but nothing ever wins. The peppermint in this gum can wipe out the worst of bad breath, and toward the end of its chewable life, it doesn't start to taste awful or give you worse breath as many gums will do; it simply loses its flavor.  Only drawbacks. I usually chew 2 pieces at a time, so they are a bit small and #2 they just changed the packaging. It used to fit nicely in your back pant pocket, inside suit jacket pocket etc, now its twice as thick and poorly layed out so it's bulky. Not sure why they had to change; probably to do with retail stores layout. This won't prevent me from buying it, but it's really annoying. Wrigley; just never change the flavor!",
