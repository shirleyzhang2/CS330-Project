Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

The tablet is still large by itself, but the thickness gives me something to grab as it bounces around. Also has openings for charging and camera when closed. Only thing that would make it 5 stars:It would be great if there was some form of closure or tab over the screen area. I know you could cut out one with scissors, but, honestly, at this price, no biggie.",

As far as I'm concerned, it's just annoying to have commercials interrupting part way through even when you're relaxing and listening to your favorite book. The story itself was fun though, so I wouldn't say don't buy it; I'll take a little distraction sometimes. But buyer beware. It's not really worth purchasing. You can find free samples on most sites like Amazon.",
