Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear.

Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

Recent evidences have suggested that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is beneficial in treating various fibrotic diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, cirrhosis, kidney fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. However, no information is known about the effect of H2S on peritoneal fibrosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of H2S on peritoneal fibrosis and explored its potential mechanisms.', 'We developed a model of peritoneal fibrosis by intraperitoneally injecting 4.25%-glucose PD fluids and lipopolysaccharide to Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of NaHS (56 \u03bcg/kg), an H2S donor. After 28 days, the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was used to assess peritoneal function. At the end of dialysis, the rats were killed and parietal peritoneum was harvested for microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry.', 'On the 28th day, the parietal peritoneum of the PD rats markedly thickened as a result of increased depositions of type III collagen and fibronectin. Moreover, the number of ED-1-positive cells and the expressions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and CD31 were significantly increased in the fibrotic peritoneum. Administration of NaHS markedly decreased the biomarkers of inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis in the peritoneum. NaHS also improved peritoneal function assessed by PET.",

In contrast, little is known about the interactions of WAT with liver. Hence, we examined the effect of the secretory products of WAT on hepatocytes. Conditioned medium of human WAT explants induced significant steatosis in hepatocyte cell lines. Factor(s) responsible for the conditioned medium-induced steatosis were screened by a battery of blocking antibodies against different cytokines/chemokines shown to be secreted by WAT. In contrast to interleukin-8 and interleukin-6, the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was capable of inducing steatosis in hepatocytes in a time-dependent manner at concentrations similar to those found in conditioned medium. Incubation of conditioned medium with antimonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 antibodies prevented triglyceride accumulation. Investigation of the mechanism leading to the triglyceride accumulation showed that both a diminution of apolipoprotein B secretion and an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase messenger RNA may be involved.",
