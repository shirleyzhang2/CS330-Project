        "For the given high-school level math question, you are supposed to output the corresponding category from the five given possible categories. The five possible categories are (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Questions belonging to category (1) 'algebra' will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable. Questions belonging to category (2) 'arithmetic' will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets. Questions belonging to category (3) 'measurement' are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit. Questions belonging to category (4) 'numbers' will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. Questions belonging to category (5) 'probability' will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category."
