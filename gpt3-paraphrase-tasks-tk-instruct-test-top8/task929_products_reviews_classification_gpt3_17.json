Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

It's very frustrating. Do NOT order, just get it from a store close by. The actual product is of high quality though. Hope this helps! :(",

Not a good product, even if it's cheap, but better than some of these in the market, which cost 2-3 times as much or more. It has low volume, too. The blue is kind of boring too. So it only works because you have to leave your iPhone nearby. Definitely can't do anything on it.",

I would probably buy something different next time because most likely ones are going back since I wasted money on this.",

They both love it! It's great that you can control how much water is dispensed through out the day and night by using 2 separate settings. This keeps your pets healthy. For those who own multiple pets... If I leave my cats overnight then come home from work..",
