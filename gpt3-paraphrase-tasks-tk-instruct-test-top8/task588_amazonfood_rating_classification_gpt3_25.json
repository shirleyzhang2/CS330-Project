They arrived in a day or two and the bottles were shiny and fresh, I was afraid of warehouse dust and old stock.  The vendor did really well.",

Went back and looked at my and sure enough the description did not state 2 boxes as other brands / suppliers.  Beware when ordering and just pick a different vendor.",

The strawberry flavor is very artificial tasting and, though I guess it is a good thing, not very long lasting. The gum also gets \"stringy\" fairly quickly.  I chew a lot of gum, but will not be buying this flavor again.  Not Recommended!  CFH",

The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone.",

I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes.",
