    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two words, and you must predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should explicitly convey the meaning of both words, for example: if the words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the correct preposition would be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
