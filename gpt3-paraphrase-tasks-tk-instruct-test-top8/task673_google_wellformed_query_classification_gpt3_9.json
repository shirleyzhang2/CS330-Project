        "The given query will be classified as 'Good' or 'Bad' depending on how well the query is formed. A 'Bad' query is one that is not well formed, while a 'Good' query is one that is well formed. If the query is well formed, but is wrong based on common sense or general facts, you should still output 'Good'."
