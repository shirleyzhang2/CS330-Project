Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

At the end of the book after being so disgusted with how it ended, I looked at all pages just to see if there are more chapters. In fact, I'm pretty sure each page is missing. It could have been great but ended up as almost too unbelievable. My recommendation when reading this, skip over chapter 1. You'll be surprised or rather you'll hate it.",

The only complaint that I've had is not with the tripod, but more so due to my own expectations for a low-price item. It does tend to shake pretty easily. Even after tightening it, it moves very easily when the wind blows against it. Overall, I'm satisfied enough with it. For less than $30, you can't really expect much.",

The organization is confusing, most of the topics are dealt in one page by a person and then there was no follow-up on any subject. But it does make an excellent reference for someone wanting to look at how their career might be affected. I learned some good things about my own career; but it wasn't easy reading. So I'm only giving 3 stars.",
