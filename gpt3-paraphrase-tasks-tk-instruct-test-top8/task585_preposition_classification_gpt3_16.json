    "Definition": [
        "Given two words, your task is to predict the preposition that connects the two words. The preposition should explicitly convey the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the preposition \"of\" would be a correct answer, because it would create the phrase \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
