            "input": "I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing \"straw grabber\" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)",

            "input": "High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags. Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month. Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea.",

They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.  They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients.",
