Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

I love this play but it can be a little corny so it's good for people with really low standards because it keeps you entertained. The music isn't that great and some actors are pretty lame especially Michael Crawford as Alice. There's not much else to say about it. It's like being stuck on an airplane listening to someone talk at you. Some songs make me want to jump up & dance.",

I use it with a small LED flashlight for all kinds of things including checking my golf swing. The LED is much stronger then the old flashlight. A plus is that I can clip this device anywhere in place which makes clipping or removing your shoes even easier. If you need a great reliable wireless device, get this.",

But they charge well just not long enough for my situation. Next time I will try one like Sony OEM. Not as expensive and work much better. Very disappointed as it is almost needed at this point where we live with out electricity. And there are no other batteries from Amazon or local stores but another vendor on Amazon.",
