Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Just yesterday the sound no longer worked when trying to turn on or change channels. This is horrible for anything besides show sound. Also some people who posted reviews said you couldn't use an ipod. You can't. Apple did screw up making that feature completely useless by adding this adapter instead of supporting it. When buying it, look at the price tag.",

The only downside to this one (compared with the other styles I've had) was that all of my items inside were getting bent in odd ways, so I had to bend down just right or rearrange them. It took me awhile to get used to, but... now, nothing gets bent. After traveling through two different countries recently, I'm still happy with it.",

Mine lasted a year, until I plugged it in one day to find my PC speaker having died. :( I'm very disappointed with this. If you are looking for cheap, these speakers may work OK but if you're an Apple fan who wants something that's long lasting, definitely look elsewhere. Don't waste your money like me. My other complaint though would have been that this product requires 4 AA batteries while it's rated at 2 amps.",

I decided to send it back and get a replacement, thinking maybe the customer representative had done something wrong and sent the broken unit again. Instead, I got yet another broken one, and no longer have any faith in Amazon for these things. It's nice they are refunding my money since the product isn't worth it. Do not buy this if you want one. It has been a frustrating experience, and it's really quite sad that such an otherwise wonderful brand sells this.",
