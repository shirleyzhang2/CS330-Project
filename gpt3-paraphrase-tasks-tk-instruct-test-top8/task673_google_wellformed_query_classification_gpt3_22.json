        "Given a query, output 'Good' if the query is well-formed, or 'Bad' if the query is not well-formed. A well-formed query is one that is formed correctly according to grammar and syntax rules. A query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but as long as it is formed correctly, you should answer with Good."
