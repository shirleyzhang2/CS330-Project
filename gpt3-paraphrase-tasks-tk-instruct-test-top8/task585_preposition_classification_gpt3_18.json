    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you're given an input that contains two words. Your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words in order to explicitly convey the meaning of both words. The possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
