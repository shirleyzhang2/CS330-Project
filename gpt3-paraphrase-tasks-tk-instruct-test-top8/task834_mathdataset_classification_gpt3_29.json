        "In this task, you are given a math question at a high school level. There are five possible categories for the question: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. You must identify the category that the question belongs to. Use the following guidelines: (1) Algebra questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable. (2) Arithmetic questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets. (3) Measurement questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit. (4) Numbers questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM, etc. (5) Probability questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question can only belong to one category."
