            "input": "I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.  Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a \"hot spot\" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an \"allergic reaction.\"  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!  Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.  In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.  It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.  ******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems. \n Summary: My Black Labrador throws up the new formula of Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food",

            "input": "I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one. \n Summary: Not one but twice came broken.",
