That is NOT the case with this powder.  This \"Chili Chipotle Powder\" is HOT HOT HOT, and seriously lacking in flavor.  The other thing is that this is an extremely fine grind, so when I sprinkle it into a sauce, enough of it enters the air and I end up inhaling it, and it feels like I'm burning my nose.  YUCK!  Stick with a plain old generic \"chili powder\" instead of this.",

However upon receiving it, it is an off brand \"My Perfect Kitchen\" sold at Bed Bath & Beyond and at HALF the price. I was disappointed in the jading and sent it back. Signed up for BBB email promos and got a 20% off coupon for use in the store so I bought this EXACT item for $20 (reg only $24.99 in store).  I mean EXACT!  Do your homework and save yourself some money.  Oh and the item itself is great...we have the larger Platinum B70 and it does have an issue with the cupboards but I just pulled it forward about 3.5in and it's perfect.  I am fortunate enough to have a lot of counter space and I may move it to an open top area so for us it's all good :)",

At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.  The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor.",
