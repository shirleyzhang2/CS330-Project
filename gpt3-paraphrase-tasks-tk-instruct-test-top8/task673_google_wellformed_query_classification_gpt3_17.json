        "You will read a given query and classify it as 'Good' or 'Bad' based on how well the query is formed. A 'Good' query is one that is well formed, while a 'Bad' query is not so well formed. A query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but if it is well formed, you should answer with 'Good'."
