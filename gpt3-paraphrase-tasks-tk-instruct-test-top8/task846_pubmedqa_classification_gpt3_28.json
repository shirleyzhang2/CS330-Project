            "input": "Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?\nAnswer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "The answer clearly says that ICLSs are elevated, which is exactly what the question asks. Hence, the output will be yes and it is correct."

            "output": "yes",

            "input": "Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?\nAnswer: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.",

            "explanation": "The answer says that psammaplin (PsA) increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, which is in accordance with the question. Hence, this output is correct."

Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.",

We conclude that given the present density of health facilities in Kenya, geographic access to curative services does not influence population-level mortality.",

Modification of nuclear proteins by SUMO-1 contributes to the antiapoptotic effects of SUMO-1 in prosthesis-loosening FLS, providing evidence for the specific activation of sumoylation during their differentiation. Therefore, SUMO-1 may be an interesting target for novel strategies to prevent aseptic prosthesis loosening.",
