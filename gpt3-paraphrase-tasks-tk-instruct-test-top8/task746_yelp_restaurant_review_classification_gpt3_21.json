            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

            "input": "This place sounds like a simple sandwich shop but is actually one of my favorite places in Boston. I always took visiting guests here because it has something for everyone. The first time I ate at Parish, I took a chance on the meatloaf sandwich, which normally I would never look at as I'm not a big meatloaf fan. That sandwich is honestly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It's got a chipotle mayo that is just incredible. It's been about 3 years since I've been here but I still crave that meatloaf sandwich all of the time. I did have the Mac and cheese at one point and from what I remember, that was great too. I'm really into Mac and cheese so I almost always try them at restaurants but usually am disappointed because I can make better, which was not the case here. I'll definitely be paying Parish a visit when I'm back in Boston.",

            "input": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.The only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It's also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

Who does that! Whom? I really wish I could remember what the name of that shot was, because down the street I went into grand mal after I woke up 3 days later.. I changed doctors.

I went with my coworkers for our holiday luncheon. we each paid $20.50 for our meal which wasnt much to choose from... I had the Po boy sandwich and the strawberry shortcake. The Po boy was more bread than anything, the fish.. Well lack of fish wasnt great, it was more breading than fish... The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the fries. The dessert 'strawberry shortcake' was a very tiny piece more like the end of a pound cake, was hard and did not taste good at all. I tried my co workers chocolate fudge cake which was also yucky and hard, tasted like old cake. My co worker had the cheese burger and she was very unhappy with her meal. She said it didnt have any flavor so she ask for BBQ sauce it made it taste a little better. To top this off they didnt even cover the parking! And did I mention that it was super dark? You could barely see in there... Yup never again!",

Very fishy smelling.- ONION STRINGS - very oniony.- FRIES - nothing special - couldve used a bit more salt.- TATER TOTS - The best - very crunchy.WARNING:  Dont waste your $$$$ here - Go to WILD WILYS instead.

Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices. Veggie-changa was too breadth and didn't have much flavor. Chips were ok. Margaritas were way too sweet. Would not go again.",
