    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two words, and your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition you choose should explicitly convey the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the correct preposition would be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
