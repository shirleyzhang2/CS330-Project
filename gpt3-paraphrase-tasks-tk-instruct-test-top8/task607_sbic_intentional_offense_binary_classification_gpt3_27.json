        "You will be given a text from a social media post. Your task is to determine whether the post is intentionally offensive or not. If the post is intentionally offensive, label it as 'yes'. If the post is not intentionally offensive, label it as 'no'. Also, label as 'no' any offensive statements that appear to be unintentional, or any non-offensive statements that are underhandedly offensive."
