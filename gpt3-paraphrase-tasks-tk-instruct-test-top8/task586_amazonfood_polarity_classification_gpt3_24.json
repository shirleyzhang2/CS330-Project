I've had regular Melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it, so I decided to give the decaf version a try. Especially when the weather gets cold, I like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later.  The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.  While I continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions, I'm glad to know there's a good, flavorful substitute for when I don't want caffeine.",

If, like me, you require gluten free, this is a great product. This is the first flavorful GF baked good I have stumbled upon. Very simple and quick to make. Like all GF products, they are pretty dense in the end, but the apples make for a nice addition and they fill you up. Personally, I added a bit more \"sugar\" (xylitol) than the recipe calls for. Next batch, I will also add some fresh apples and extra cinnamon. My only complaint is that you get so little out of the box (makes 6 small muffins).",

I have ordered all varieties they had on amazon, whole wheat honey is specially tasty. no more supermarket bread!",
