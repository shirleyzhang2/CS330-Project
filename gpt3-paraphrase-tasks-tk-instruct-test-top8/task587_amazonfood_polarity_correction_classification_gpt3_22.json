The variety of flavors in this package was great and I enjoy most of them.  These chips leave a lot less mess than your average bags of potato chips and there are very few crumbs in the bag.  It is apparent these are not prepared like normal chips and the result is a differently textured chip.

Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice. \n Polarity: Positive",
