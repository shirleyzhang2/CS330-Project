    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two words, and your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should explicitly convey the meaning of both words, for example, if the words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the preposition \"of\" would be the correct choice. Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
