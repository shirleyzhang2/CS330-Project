Spicy (but not burning spicy, more like tongue-warming), sweetish, salty...a really strongly-flavored and delicious chip. If you like barbecue flavor, this is a nice sweet-Mexi-fied barecue.  I also like that it's organic.  I ate the 5 oz bag in less than 15 minutes. My bad. But dang, if they're not sinfully delicious.  Granted, 5oz is not a whole lot (it was skimpy for the price, which is often the case when it comes to organic), but it was 750 calories at a pop. Geesh.  Yes, 150 cals per 1 oz serving. That's about par for the course for fried chips.  Verdict: Fattening, crispy, flavorful, delicious. Best to stick to very small servings on the side of a low-fat sandwich or soup.  Enjoy.  Mir",

We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc).  Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right.  Soon, however, the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the \"cap\" on.  Now it is useless.",

            "input": "I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing \"straw grabber\" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)",
