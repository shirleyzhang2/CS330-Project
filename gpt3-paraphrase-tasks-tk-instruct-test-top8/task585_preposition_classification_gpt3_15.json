    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an input containing two words. You need to predict the preposition that connects these two words in a way that explicitly conveys the meaning of both words. The possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
