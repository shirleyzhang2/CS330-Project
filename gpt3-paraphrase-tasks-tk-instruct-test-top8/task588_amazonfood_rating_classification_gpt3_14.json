It hasn't any odd taste, and tastes better than sugar to me. I buy the large 12 ounce container and it lasts me for months! I only wish they would put this in more products sold at the grocery stores. There is a soda that has stevia in it that I purchase at a health food store called Virgil's Zero and it comes in different flavors...it is great and I don't have to be concerned about the sugar content that is in traditional sodas. This product is great and I think is the best of stevia products on the market.",

BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of \"Yeast Extract\".  It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.  Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive.",
