Here is only one review of one of the ingredients in these crackers.... ------------------------------------------------------ AMMONIUM BICARBONATE Ammonia powder is ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent that is a precursor of today's baking powder and baking soda; it must be ground to a powder before using. It is also known as hartshorn, carbonate of ammonia or powdered baking ammonia. It is still called for in some recipes especially for cookies.  It is suggested substituting an equal amount of double acting baking powder for the powdered ammonia (hartshorn) in a recipe.  (Your kitchen would stink of ammonia while the cookies baked, but the cookies would not taste or smell of ammonia --------------------------------------------------------- Now doesn't that just make you want to gobble up these crackers,..NOT.  Most of the product comes from China....another caution.  It is preferred by some food processors because it is CHEAP....so how expensive is common baking soda &bakin g powder?",

No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.",
