            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "The word \"nostalgic\" could either indicate \"love\" or \"sadness\", but the fact that it is still on the property eliminates \"love\"."

        {
            "input": "i feel romantic too",
            "output": "joy",
            "explanation": "This statement clearly indicates joy, but the joy particularly relates to romance. So, the correct label must be \"love\" instead."

            "output": "love",
            "explanation": "Since the author feels that he must find a purpose for the suffering, the sentence has a negative outlook. So, the label should be \"sadness\" and not \"love\"."
