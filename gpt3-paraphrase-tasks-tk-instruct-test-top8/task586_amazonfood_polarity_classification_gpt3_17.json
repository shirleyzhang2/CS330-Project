I sent an email to the customer support - no response, after 3 weeks I checked and found that they made the picture larger (good) but left the product description without change. As for me, it is crazy expensive shipping while I can get same Fat free or Reduced fat milk at StopNShop or Market Basket. The difficult thing is to find whole milk. Funny that Whole milk as natural product became unpopular. I guess too many people are concerned about becoming overweight:)",

Why would I do that with an airpopper you ask?  Because the airpopper was a gift.  I really can't tell a whole lot of difference in the taste from Orville R. and this, but what I have read is this is organic and much better for you.  But the price is well...pricey. No I don't intend to buy again for that reason, but should my conscience tweek me towards healthier choice popcorn again then I may change my mind.",

The clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky, for lack of a better term.  The flavor was also very lacking...it didn't really taste like, well, anything.  Definitely not worth the price.  I can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for Bar Harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder.",

I would not have ordered this product had I known the bottles were plastic due to concerns about toxins in plastic.  I pay extra for Amazon Prime and expect to be able to return an UNOPENED ITEM if it is not what I thought it would be.  Not only will Amazon.com not allow me to return this item, they have deleted my prior feedback on the item.  Hopefully they will not delete this feedback too as it is VERY RELEVANT for customers in deciding which items to purchase.  If you don't want plastic bottles, do not order this set.",

I really thought this toy would be a terrific idea for him but he is absolutely terrified of it.  He growls and barks at it, won't even smell it.

I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.  So far I've ordered the following products:  1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots  2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots  The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.  3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.  4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)  Taste great if you are a jerky lover.  5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots  6) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.  7) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.  All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.  Gunner  January, 2010",
