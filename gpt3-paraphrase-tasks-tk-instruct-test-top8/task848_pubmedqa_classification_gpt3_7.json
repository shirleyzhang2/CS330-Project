Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

Our aim was to determine the association between galectin-3 levels and all-cause and CVD mortality in community-dwelling older adults without known CVD.', 'We measured plasma galectin-3 levels in 1,393 Rancho Bernardo Study participants without CVD with a mean age of 70 years. Participants were followed up for a mean of 11 years for coronary heart disease, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality.', 'During follow-up, 436 participants died (169 from CVD). In models adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors and renal function, galectin-3 was a significant predictor of CVD mortality (hazard ratio [HR] per SD log increase 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.53) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.12, 1.01-1.24), but not coronary heart disease (HR 1.09, 0.92-1.30). After further adjusting for N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, galectin-3 remained an independent predictor (HR 1.24, 1.05-1.47) of CVD mortality. Galectin-3 improved the c statistic (0.847-0.851, P = .003) for prediction of CVD death.

A long-standing hypothesis suggests that a high arousal threshold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is mediated by sleep spindle oscillations, impairing thalamocortical transmission of incoming sensory stimuli. Here we set out to test this idea directly by examining sensory-evoked neuronal spiking activity during natural sleep.', 'We compared neuronal (n = 269) and multiunit activity (MUA), as well as local field potentials (LFP) in rat core auditory cortex (A1) during NREM sleep, comparing responses to sounds depending on the presence or absence of sleep spindles.', 'We found that sleep spindles robustly modulated the timing of neuronal discharges in A1. However, responses to sounds were nearly identical for all measured signals including isolated neurons, MUA, and LFPs (all differences < 10%). Furthermore, in 10% of trials, auditory stimulation led to an early termination of the sleep spindle oscillation around 150-250 msec following stimulus onset. Finally, active ON states and inactive OFF periods during slow waves in NREM sleep affected the auditory response in opposite ways, depending on stimulus intensity.",
