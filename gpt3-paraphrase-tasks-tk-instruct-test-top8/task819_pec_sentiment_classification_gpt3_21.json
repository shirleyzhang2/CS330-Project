        "Given a sentence in English, provide the sentiment based on its empathetic direction. There are two possible classifications: positive (happy) or negative (offmychest). Positive means the sentence is about something happy. Negative means the sentence is about something that someone wants to get off their chest."

            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "This is considered positive sentiment since the speaker disjuncts \"was down for a long time\" with their new changed hair insinuating a positive sentiment; therefore, it is correctly classified."

            "input": "i hate working . i know most people feel the same way . i just absolutely hate working 40 hours a week . i feel like i \u2019m wasting my life away at work . i hate it . i \u2019d rather do so many other things . after i graduated undergrad , i went back to school after a year because i hated working full time . after graduating with my masters , i still hate working .",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "In this example, it would be classified as negative sentiment because the context speaker uses strong negative connotative words such as \"hate\", \"wasting\", \"rather\", etc; so, it is classified correctly"

    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "i have spent more than half my life biting my nails as an anxiety coping mechanism . today it 's exactly 3 months since i 'd stopped . it makes me so happy and proud and i have no one else to share it with .",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "In this context, it is not correctly classified as the speaker mentions extreme feelings of happiness after stopping a negative habit and use of the word \"proud\""

        {
            "input": "i hate . i hate that i feel in love with the person i consider my best friend . i hate the fact that i know the only way i can stop having stop these feelings is to completely remove her from my life . i hate the fact that its going that its going to hurt us . i hate that i 've to come to this decision",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "This example is incorrectly classified as positive; whereas, it should be classified as positive because the speaker uses strong negatively-connotated words such as \"hate\", \"stop\", \"remove\", and \"hurt\"."
