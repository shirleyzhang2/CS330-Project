        "In this task, you are given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. There are three possibilities: the two sentences clearly agree (entailment) with each other, they don't clearly agree with each other, and there is no way to determine their relationship with each other. For example, if sentence 2 were a conclusion of sentence 1, it would be clear that sentence 1 was the cause of sentence 2. This would be a case of entailment. Or, if sentence 2 were the cause of sentence 1, sentence 2 would be the conclusion of sentence 1. This would be a case of contradiction. Or, if sentence 2 was a conclusion of sentence 1, sentence 2 would be the cause of sentence 1. This would be a case of neutral entailment. Follow the example above, generate a detailed paraphrase for the following without losing information. ",
