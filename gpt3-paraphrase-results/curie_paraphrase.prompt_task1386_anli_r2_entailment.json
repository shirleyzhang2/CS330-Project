        "You will be presented with a premise and a hypothesis sentence. You need to output whether the hypothesis sentence entails (implies), contradicts (opposes), or is neutral with respect to the given premise. The main focus of the test is on technical analysis. For example, in a price analysis task, participants might be given a statement such as: Paraphrase: Price analysis indicates that price will rise to a maximum of 3.7% over the next two weeks. In the task, participants would then be asked to indicate their confidence in their prediction. In the above example, participants might respond as follows: Participants are given a statement and are asked to select a confidence level for their answer. The response can be \"exact\", \"very likely\", \"likely\", \"no confidence\", \"very unlikely\", \"not likely\" or \"very unlikely\". The way the statistics work, accuracy rates for \"exact\" and \"very likely\" vary, with \"very likely\" having a higher accuracy rate. Some of the tasks are significantly different from other versions of the test. For example, in a task in which participants are given a sentence, participants might be asked, \"Which of the following is false?",
        "In this task, you will be presented with a premise and a hypothesis sentence. You need to determine whether the hypothesis sentence entails (implies), contradicts (opposes), or is neutral with respect to the given premise. Please answer with \"Contradiction\", \"Neutral\", or \"Entailment\". ",
        "You will be presented with a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence. You need to determine whether the hypothesis sentence entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to the given premise sentence. It is guaranteed that the answer is either \"Contradiction\", \"Neutral\", or \"Entailment\". "
