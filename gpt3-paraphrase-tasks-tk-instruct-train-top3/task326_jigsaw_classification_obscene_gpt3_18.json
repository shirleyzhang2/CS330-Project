        "You are given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment as either obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is considered taboo in polite usage."
