            "input": "boring.... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine \"greatest hits\" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is \"Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun\" etc etc etc? The albums \"Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back\" as well as \"Live at the El Mocambo\" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did. You just wouldn't know it from this pap.",

            "input": "So Hot It's Cool . I noticed that all the reviews are pretty short, so I'll try and keep mine short, as well. I bought this album around seven or eight years ago when I was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse. Because my personal dwelling space was so small, I wanted to create an illusion that my place was big, spacious and open and I did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories, but by creating  a \"big atmosphere\" through the music I chose to play when I had guests over.    Whenever I played this CD at dinner parties I threw, people literally stopped and noticed the music. I had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated, but for the most part, people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can.    What I'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart, a lot of soul, a lot of punch for the buck. If you find yourself listening to the same old music, you might just want to pick up this CD and expose yourself to something so cool, it's hot",
