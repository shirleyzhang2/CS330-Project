So many people had mentioned how lovely the brunch menu is here... \\n\\nI am happy to say that we have found our new favorite breakfast / brunch destination! Vincent's has the best brunch menu in all of the Valley--hands down. \\n\\nWe started with the four tiny croissants and jam that our friends had mentioned were so delicious (they were!). My boyfriend had the lobster quiche which arrived with a side of greens and I ordered the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelette. We also shared cinnamon raison brioche which came to us warm, full of raisons, with a perfectly \\\"\"eggy\\\"\" taste. Everything was absolutely wonderful and our only concern was that we couldn't possibly finish everything they had brought! \\n\\nThe prices are considerably lower than what you'd expect to pay for such a delightful meal. :-)\\n\\nMy boyfriend commented that this is the best brunch spot he's found since he left New York.",

            "input": "Been going to this spot for a few years now. It's always a good place to eat. It's small and the selection is really good. The \\\"\"all you can eat\\\"\" covers pretty much the whole menu, which is a plus. \\n\\nThe wait staff is fantastic. The place is clean and the prices are just right. Top it off with it just being down the street from home and that's a win-win. If it's not too busy, the chefs can make you some really nice 'off-the-menu' items...very much like the secret menu at In-and-Out.\\n\\nOne thing to note though, on a trip to the bathroom, I did hear one of the new chefs just totally berating the staff and being an uber douchebag. From what i found, he's not even a senior guy...he's a new guy barely there a month and already acting like he owns the place. \\n\\nDEAR OWNER: keep your eye on this guy. I'd hate for your place to start getting that unhappy vibe if the wait staff is under oppression by a tyrant sushi chef.  Otherwise, keep up the good work. Business all around are shutting down and you guys are going strong. I'm a loyal customer. See on the next round....",
