We did not use his full name or photo to protect his identity -- although Ziauddin insisted we do so. I asked him what an average day was like and he told me, \"Young lady, young boys are being slaughtered here before our very eyes like goats.\" I was shocked by the savage image this simple statement had generated in my mind, yet this man had no fear of speaking to us.Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Malala, has been a huge influence on his daughterHe backed her right to education in Pakistan despite the Taliban threatMalala was shot by the Taliban after defying them with her insistence on going to schoolPakistan is a male-dominated society where women often lack the opportunities men have \n Questions:We have not heard from and do not know much about _'s mother.
