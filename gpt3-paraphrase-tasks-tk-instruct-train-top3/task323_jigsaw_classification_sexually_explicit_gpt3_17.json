It goes as follows...\nWords right out of a terrorist's mouth!!\nMasuma Khan posts on Facebook... \"White fragility can kiss my ass. Your white tears aren't sacred, your land is.\" This doesn't sound very Canadian to me, sounds more like the threat of a terrorist. We, real true Canadians, don't take kindly to threats... You think we are frail - we have a surprise for you! Watch out white people - this woman will stab you in the back without thinking twice.\nShe should not just face disciplinary action for her racist remark... she should be put on the \"Terrorist Watch List\". What she said was a direct threat to the white race .. who are we kidding??\nHer words are no different than those of the ISIS terrorist's who post their threats to the World Cup...\nAt least we white's know who our friends are .. definitely not her.\nKICK HER OUT!!",
