        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You have to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). Output 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish. Output 'No' if the verb does not refer to an opinion, intention, or wish."
