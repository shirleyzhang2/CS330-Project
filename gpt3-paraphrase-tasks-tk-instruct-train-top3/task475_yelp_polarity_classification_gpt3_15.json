            "input": "I recently moved to the area and pass by this place all the time.  I figured I'd give it a try and popped in to check it out for lunch.  The bar had a nice mellow atmosphere, with customers bantering to each other about the various sports games on the monitors.  The bartender immediately came by to take my drink order and give me a menu when one of the bar guests who probably had some money riding on a college football game started screaming when his team gave up the ball.  Along with the other bar goers, the bar tender jeered him in good humor while pouring my Newcastle.  \\n\\nAces is the kind of place that makes you feel like a regular even if you've never been.  Their beer selection is okay, but the quality of the food is outstanding.  I ordered a Reuben that totally knocked my socks off, it came out quickly, and could go toe to toe with any NYC deli creation.  This was a pleasant experience, between the good food, company, atmosphere, and friendly, not fake-friendly, service.  I will definitely be back!",

            "input": "Usually one of my favorite stops during first fridays or second Saturdays. \\n\\nMusic: Depending on what day you go this joint can play a variety of EDM genres. Not my usual cup of tea but my most recent experience was a tech house night. To my surprise I loved it. It felt like a very down town lounge urban underground LA night. If your standing outside Vanguard as you walk pass it you can definitely hear they're amazing sound system bumping. Its the loudest on the busy bar hoping street. Cover is always free so if you looking for some good beats and down town love go to Van guard.\\n\\nPrice of drinks: A bit pricey for a small location, but I guess it was the weekend. The prices were a bit high and the drinks weren't that strong. \\n\\nJust a note: I suggest going to El Cortez's bar and grabbing a few cheap drinks before heading to Van guard. The amount you'd spend on one drink at Van guard would equal about 2 drinks at El Cortez. Also find a FREE parking garage El Cortez is no longer a free parking garage even though they have a HUGE sign that says FREE parking LOL False advertisement!!!",
