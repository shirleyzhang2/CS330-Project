            "input": "Review: Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."
