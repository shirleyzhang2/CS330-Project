Same damn premise anyone can lie to a doctor to get what they want.\n\nHence why proof is out moded.  Also this is why you're supposed to WASH your produce before you eat it.  Are you just ignorant on purpose or what? \n\nI'm way more concerned over people who don't wash their hands after using the toilet than I am some dog in a shopping cart. \n\nSome of those ESAs are cute but still considered an animal doing a service if the person says they have anxiety and a doctor agrees that it helps then boom.  They have a disability and fluffy can go anywhere they go.  Dinner, movies, etc",
