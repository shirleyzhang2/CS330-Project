    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). The input is from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages. Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, and 'No' if it does not. Elicit-pref is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",
            "output": "No",

            "output": "Yes",
