            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",
            "output": "4",
            "explanation": "The passage talks about optical mice or mouse throughout which is a part of computer system. Thus, it is correctly classified to \"Computers & Internet\" "

The resulting fat is similar to\nsaturated fat, which raises \"bad\" LDL cholesterol\nand can lead to clogged arteries and heart\ndisease. \\nUntil very recently, food labels were\nnot required to list trans fats, and this health\nrisk remained hidden to consumers. In early July,\nFDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon\nbegin identifying trans fat content in processed\nfoods.",

            "explanation": "Throughout the passage, food, clogged arteries and heart\ndisease are discussed in relation to Trans fats, which all are closely related to the topic \"Health\". Thus, passage is correctly classified."

It is sooo hard, especially around your \"triggers\". For me, it's at home after work. My dad told me when he quit he would go for a walk or take a drink of water. I have tried them as well. I have not had luck with the patch nor the gum. I am trying cold turkey again. I have a straw I \"inhale\" at home .. just a straw. It seems to be working. Then I think about how gross it is and why I don't want to do it anymore. There's a great commercial out there that shows a dr saying he doesn't think he can operate and then a smoker saying I dont' think I can quit.\\nI think the clincher for me is that my best friends kids are 13 and 14 and are both smoking. I was a little bit younger than that so I am trying to be a good example to them. I have to quit. \\nI wish you success in the new year to quit smoking.",
