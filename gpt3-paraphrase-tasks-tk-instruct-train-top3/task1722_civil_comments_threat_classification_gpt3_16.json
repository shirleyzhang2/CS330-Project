This is not only true for the recently killed alpha male but it actually dates back to Feb 2005 when Coke Wallace killed the alpha female of East Fork. This has caused an unrelenting series of disruptions including the dispersal of the alpha male to the south where he was shot south of Cantwell in April of 2005 leaving six 1-2 year olds. \n\nSince that time, the disruption caused by these 2005 deaths have lead to severe territorial shifting to the east & then north further exposing them to trapper/hunter caused deaths, changes in den sites, changes in use of the park road corridor, to the point where the primary family group of wolves with the longest lineage in Denali has seldom been seen since the summer of 2004. \n\nA question to ask NPS is how can they manage for the overall population & give no consideration to the importance of individuals & family groups?",
