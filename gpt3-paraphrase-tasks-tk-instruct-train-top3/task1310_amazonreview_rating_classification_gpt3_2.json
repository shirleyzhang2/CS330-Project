I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

It has done the complete opposite. It has dried out my hands and left them looking scaly - literally! This was after about a week of using it. It has also left my hands so dry that I am snagging my clothing when I have to put clothes on or adjust them, especially nylons. I am sending it back. I'll go back to my previous hand lotion, which never left them dry. I just tried this because it supposedly had healthier ingredients and didn't leave a greasy residue.",
