The reason we have comparatively many killings is that we as a society teach that human life is not worth much.  The perfect example is the massive support for killing Finicum.  We as a people supported his death because we didn't like how he acted.  We support drones firing missiles to kill sleeping Moslems.  We support jets dropping bombs on innocents described as collateral damage.  We support locking humans in cages for most of their lives for relatively minor property or non-violent \"sex\" crimes.  All of these instances reflect a profound disrespect for the sanctity people's lives.  When society as a whole teaches that people are disposable as a matter of convenience, it is not surprising in the least that individuals reach similar conclusions and are moved to kill.  As long as we as a society teach disrespect for life.  Killings will continue.",

If you wish a clearer picture, look at the absolute doctors' earnings with some perspective.http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/how-much-do-doctors-in-other-countries-make/?_r=0\n\nYour argument that physicians' wishes for higher salaries should drive the argument is turning the telescope around: we aren't a medical dictatorship, are we?\nIf American doctors will not work for more reasonable recompense, there is a world of doctors out there that would love to work here.\n\nAgain, is it about allowing the pigs to slop up as much as they wish, leaving nothing for anyone else, or is it about instituting some rules that protect the majority?",

As mayor of Anchorage Begich grew the Anchorage operating budget from $294 million in 2003 to $422 million when he left in 2009.\n\nVetoing the state budget results in all state employees being given lay off notices just weeks before the new fiscal year.  That would be divisive and stupid.\n\nBegich also calls for new taxes and a raid on the Permanent Fund which are both recessionary.  Begich was missing in action when we were having a statewide debate on SB-21- which is mostly responsible for the massive deficits we have today.  But nowhere in this article does Begich mention the fiasco of how we give away almost $10 billion in oil per year for only the royalty payment due to SB-21.\n\nFinally, Begich gave us the disaster that is ACA- and its crippling insurance costs.\n\nBegich needs to go away.  He failed Alaska multiple times.",
