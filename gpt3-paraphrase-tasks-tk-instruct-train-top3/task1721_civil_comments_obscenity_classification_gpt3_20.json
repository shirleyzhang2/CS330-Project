In 2014, there were 66,500 confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect in Texas. If there were ANY cases of someone pretending to be transgender in order to access bathrooms with members of the opposite sex, I am pretty sure it would be in the news. Yet the uproar is about the bathroom issue. I find the argument that this is for \"the children\" to be disingenuous at best.",
