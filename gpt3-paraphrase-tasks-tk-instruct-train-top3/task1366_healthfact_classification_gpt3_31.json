            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

According to the National Cancer Institute, genetic testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can cost anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars and insurance does not always provide coverage. The story provides information regarding the relative and absolute risks associated with developing\u00a0breast\u00a0and ovarian cancer in patients with and without\u00a0a mutation in the\u00a0BRCA1 gene. For additional perspective, it would have been useful for the reader to know how many breast cancers are associated with\u00a0BRCA gene\u00a0mutations in the general population. While the story underscores how BRCA testing can lead to preventive measures to reduce the risk of developing cancer, it only mentions prophylactic surgery and not the less invasive options. There\u00a0is no discussion of the emotional or social ramifications associated with receiving genetic testing results. Even receiving a negative result could lead to feelings of guilt, especially if other family members have tested positive. The story also fails to mention that undergoing prophylactic surgery to remove the ovaries, uterus and breast tissue can have serious effects on a woman\u2019s health and quality of life. This story does not include a discussion regarding sensitivity or specificity of BRCA testing. The reliability of these tests, including information on false negative and false positive results, would be beneficial. Without providing a clear discussion on what\u00a0constitutes a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer, readers who are not necessarily candidates for genetic testing may incur undue worry. It would have also been useful for the reader to know that only a very small number of breast cancers are associated with\u00a0BRCA gene\u00a0mutations. This story only provides commentary from one patient. Perspective from a genetic counselor and/or oncologist would have added value to this story, as would interviews with women who received a negative result and those who received a positive result, but dealt with the information differently. This story only discusses prophylactic surgery as an option for patients who test positive for mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Increased cancer surveillance, risk reduction behaviors, and chemoprevention should have also been presented as options. Genetic counseling services are not widely available in some geographic areas; however, this\u00a0is not mentioned in the story. The story does not suggest that genetic testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is a novel test; however, information on how long it has been available would have been useful.

Some of his seven staff, including three pilots, could lose their jobs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be greatly affected, we\u2019re anticipating probably damn near shutting the doors. It\u2019s going to be devastating, we\u2019ve been operating that part of our business for years,\u201d he said. Law is not alone worrying about his future in Whakatane, a picturesque town of 35,000 of the shore of the Bay of Plenty that is the main access point to the volcanic island. Anne Tolley, the local member of parliament, said the town was shattered by the disaster and its thoughts were with the victims, but hoped that tours would one day restart. \u201cIt is iconic and it is certainly is the centerpiece of the town\u2019s tourism. We also have fantastic beaches and walks and the kiwi, but Whakaari, you will have seen all the signs, we are the gateway to Whakaari,\u201d Tolley told Reuters, using the M\u0101ori name for the volcano. Daily tours had taken more than 10,000 visitors every year to privately owned island 50km (30 miles) off the coast. Tours to the island were part of Whakatane\u2019s history, and operators had been gearing up for the peak Christmas holiday season before Monday\u2019s disaster, Tolley said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult coming at probably the busiest time of year for them. It will be devastating.\u201d  On Monday, the 48-year-old Law had quickly organized three other pilots to fly out to the island, where they picked up 10 badly burned people and flew them back to Whakatane\u2019s hospital. Law and his team tried to fly back to the island to recover the bodies of those they knew had died, but were \u201ctremendously disappointed\u201d to be stopped by police. After initially being sidelined from police operations, by mid-week Law was sharing his knowledge of the volcano\u2019s terrain and environment with the military squad that on Friday retrieved six of the eight bodies left behind. On the weekend, the search continued for the remaining bodies. \u201cAt the end of the day people on the ground generally know and it is important\u2026 to weave into the plan the effort of the local people,\u201d Law told Reuters. Shock had ripped through Whakatane at the eruption, with the local hospital overwhelmed as dozens of seriously injured people were delivered from the island. Whakatane\u2019s tourism sector had been growing strongly with the unique marine volcano at its heart, but with the prospect that people may be reluctant to visit the island even if it is reopened, immediate prospects will be challenging. As the recovery mission on Friday played out, Boz Te Moana, 24, and Michael Mika, 28, waited to support their community gathered in the indigenous M\u0101ori marae, or meeting ground. The two, who had traveled from their homes further up the Whakatane River, hoped in time tours to the waters around the island would be allowed again but tourists should not step foot on it again, out of respect for the dead, they said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the mamae or the hurt will ever change, but the environment, it\u2019s up to the town itself to move forward from here in the most positive way,\u201d said Te Moana, using the M\u0101ori word for pain.
