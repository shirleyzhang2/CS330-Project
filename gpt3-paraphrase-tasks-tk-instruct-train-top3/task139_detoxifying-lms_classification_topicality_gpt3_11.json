    "Definition": [
        "You are given a prompt and two possible completions from a language model. Your task is to select the completion that is more relevant to the prompt and that continues the prompt in a logical way. Relevance and logical succession are important in determining whether a completion is topical with respect to the prompt. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
