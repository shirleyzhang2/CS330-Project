I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Polarity: negative",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Polarity: positive",

The respawn 110 is an amazing chair, really comfortable, love the fact it fully reclines with an leg rest, comfortable after hours of gaming, over all great product. Now for the cons of the product. Inconvenient to pull out the leg rest, you cant adjust the arm rest while laying back, needs better lumbar support while sitting in an upright position for a extended period of time. My conclusion of the product is a great buy for any gamer, or just to have as an office chair. \n Polarity: negative",
