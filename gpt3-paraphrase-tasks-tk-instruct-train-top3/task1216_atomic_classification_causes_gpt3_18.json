        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events will be short phrases possibly involving participants.

You will need to determine whether the Head causes the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
