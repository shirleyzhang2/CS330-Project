        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: identity-attack or non-identity-attack. An identity attack is any comment that is rude or disrespectful about someone's identity, including appearance, race, gender, and sexual orientation. A non-identity-attack is any comment that is not an identity attack."

He hated it almost as much as he hated Jews (as his book, ON JEWS AND THEIR LIES, attests). His followers thought they were God's chosen People, too. In his recent book, THE PROTESTANTS, Alec Ryrie notes that Luther's follower -- owing to their great love of God and Scripture -- embarked (years after Luther's death) upon bloody religious wars, burnings, martyrdom and regicide. And among competing Protestants, every opponent became a papal anti-Christ! lol.\n\nOf course, the fiercest hatred today is silent; it is racial hatred. And that is everywhere. And Muslims -- in second place on the hatred chart -- are seen by many as mini-anti-Christ's for believing their faith is true when it is opposed to everyone's else's truth. Oh what are we to do with all this holiness and self-righteousness! \n\nHatred like a falling axe never loses its weight even in the most innocent, holy hands.",
