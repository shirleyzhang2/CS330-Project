The old rancher said, \"When you're driving down a country road on you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that's a 'post turtle\".\n \nThe old rancher saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain. \"You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, and he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with\".",
