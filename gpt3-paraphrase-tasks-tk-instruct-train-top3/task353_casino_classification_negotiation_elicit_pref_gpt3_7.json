    "Definition": [
        "The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, otherwise output No. Elicit-pref is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

            "input": "Context: 'What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.' 'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "The primary utterance does not try to elicit information on the preference order of the participant. So this is correct."

            "output": "Yes",

I love food, too...especially sugar!  \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42'\nUtterance: 'Oh, that does change things a lot. Diabetes is a hard disease to have to deal with. So you want more firewood than water?
