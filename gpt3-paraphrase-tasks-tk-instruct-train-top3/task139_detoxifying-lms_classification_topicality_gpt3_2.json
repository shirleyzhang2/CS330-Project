    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a prompt and two completions from a language model. You need to select the completion that is more topical with respect to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is considered to be topical if the completion maintains relevance and logical succession with the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
