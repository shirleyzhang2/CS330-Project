        "You will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your task is to classify the question as \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". An extractive question can be answered by combining extracts from the context into a summary. An abstractive question requires paraphrasing the context using new sentences. A yes-no question is a question whose answer is either yes or no."

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",
