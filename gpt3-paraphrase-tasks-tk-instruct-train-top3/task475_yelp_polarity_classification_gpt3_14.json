            "input": "Thoroughly underwhelming. Crispy overdone meat, mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor.  Bobby Flay's place across the street should not worry. The only spark of innovation they have is a hamburger that's well over a pound.",

We had a four top and the waitress forgot to put one of our orders in correctly.  She didn't figure it out until after three meals were brought out.  So, three of us ate and the 4th person in our party had to wait 20 minutes more for their food.  We were finished by the time the 4th plate arrived.   It was very awkward and ruined the dining experience.",

We wanted to watch basketball so we had to squint a little.\\n\\nThe food was spot on. Also they have a very nice beer selection. It is a little pricey but the service and food were exceptional.\\n\\nWe shared two orders of chicken wings which are really chicken drumsticks.  They were really good and come with a blue cheese dressing.\\n\\nI had a chop salad, which is really a half a head of iceberg lettuce with quarter inch thick pieces of bacon.  They chilled the head of lettuce so it is very crunchy and fresh and cold.  At $14 I was a little skeptical, but after eating it it was very tasty with quality bacon.",
