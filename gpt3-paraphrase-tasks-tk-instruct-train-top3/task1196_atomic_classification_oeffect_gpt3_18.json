        "In this task, you are given a tuple of Head and Tail events. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, the event in the Tail will happen or not. These events are social actions that may occur after the Head event. For example, if the Head event is \"X gets hugged\", the Tail event may be \"Y blushes in response\". Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
