    "Definition": [
        "You are given a tweet that contains irony. Classify the type of irony and label the tweets (\"polarity\",\"situational\",\"other\") accordingly. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. There are other kinds of ironies that are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
