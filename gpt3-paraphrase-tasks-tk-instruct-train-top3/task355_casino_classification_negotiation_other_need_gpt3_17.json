    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the other-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. 'other-need' is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves. For example, describing the need for firewood to keep the kids warm."

So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you.
