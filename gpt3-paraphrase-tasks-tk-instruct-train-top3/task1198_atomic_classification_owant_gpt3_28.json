    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail will be events involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced with generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others. For example, if PersonX gives PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
