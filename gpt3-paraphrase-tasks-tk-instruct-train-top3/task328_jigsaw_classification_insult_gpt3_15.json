Old-school theory has it that a sharp demarcation is good because it minimizes stray light, delivering lumens right where the design engineer wants them and nowhere else.  So I can see why they'd strive for that.\n\nBut the engineer isn't an MD and hasn't a clue about the physiologic (and even psychologic) effects of these abrupt transitions. \n\nAnd alignment?  Nowadays it's nothing more than the red-haired stepchild to vehicle design fashions.  Function follows form, at a considerable distance.",
