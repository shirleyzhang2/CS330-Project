That's pretty much what I look for when I go for sushi, and I was not disappointed.  \\nStaff was VERY friendly and service was good, no complaints from me at all, and I can be a curmudgeon.\\nThe Sushi chef was knowledgeable, and was not timid to make recommendations when asked.  Another review mentioned the peppers, and I tried them on the chef's recommendation.  They will now be a staple for me.\\nI WILL be returning regularly!",
