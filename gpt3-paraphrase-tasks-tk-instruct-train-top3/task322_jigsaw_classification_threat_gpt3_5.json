Do Dr Verncombe and career influenza physician Alison McGeer truly want to pretend healthcare workers, who are entrusted to life saving decisions everyday, are stupid and reckless, \"swayed\" by myths and lore? There is not a single RCT to illustrate healthcare worker vaccination helps protect vulnerable patients. There is zero evidence healthcare workers harm patients during influenza season. There is zero evidence masks do a single thing on a healthy, asymptomatic nurse other then shame them and undermine patient care. This political and industry motivated campaign is a reckless waste of precious public resources.",
