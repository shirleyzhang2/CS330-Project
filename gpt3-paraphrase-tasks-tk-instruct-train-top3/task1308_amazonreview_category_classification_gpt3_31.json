            "input": "Review: Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

Playing anything becomes impossible when about half your notes don't register. It appears to be very cheaply made. Amazon refuses to return due to health and safety issues. However, they issued a full refund when I asked about returning it. I would absolutely not purchase this again or recommend getting one. \n Category: wireless",

I had them replaced and clearly instructed the Amazon service rep to make sure the replacement locks were keyed alike. I was assured they would make sure. I'm now ordering my third set of replacement locks. Hopefully this third set will be keyed alike. Hate to give a low star rating as the locks seem very solid, but Amazon and it's third party sellers need to improve their communication. Once I receive a set that is keyed alike I will change the rating to reflect the lock quality. \n Category: home_improvement",
