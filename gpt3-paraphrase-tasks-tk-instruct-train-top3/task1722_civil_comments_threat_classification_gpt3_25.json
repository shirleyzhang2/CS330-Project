Reporters asked the famous bank-robbing safe-cracker Willy Sutton a similar question, \"Willy, why did you keep robbing so many banks for so long?\".  \"Because that`s where they keep the money\" Willy answered.   Old criminals can add Dick, why can`t you and the rest of the oil shills?  The following chart does NOT include UN-conventional oil and gas from shale oil and gas fracking, or heavy oil, or hydrates.  Those have reserves as well as far as the state goes, even as unproven reserves.. they add value to being in Alaska sir, rather than Saudi Arabia where Exxon bid a production job to only make two dollars a barrel after costs.  They made 123% internal rate of return under ACES! They wanted more, and got it by illegally gerrymandering around certain \"enclaves\" of communities, then have their conflicted folks destroy ACES.",
