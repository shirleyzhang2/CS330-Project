) .\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal .\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day .\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences ' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs .\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) .\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double - natured photographer .\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight .\nshe is n't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model .\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed .\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable .\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language .\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me .\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down .\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts .\ndavid mamet 's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid .\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which does n't end with the normal high - strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift .\nit 's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear .\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear .\nway to go , bart .",
