(After fueling stations deem it fiesable). That's a seriously long drive, and airfare beats those costs 10 fold. \n\nKnik arm. No. Not only would it save a small amount of time. It is chalk full of unconsolidated soils that would be subject to extreme damages from settling and an inevitable DISASTER when an earthquake strikes. The glenn is not that bad. They just need to make that sucker 3 lanes deep the entire way. \n\nIn the end, it is Fairbanks that will boom due to the incoming F-35 squadrons. Probably another 5k troops to benefit to the economy there. \n\nWe can see benefits in almost anything, sh*t=fertilizer. If you have a million dollars and you buy a million dollar house, it may be cool for awhile. \n\nUp until the property taxes come due. I'm a firm believer that building on crap will become crap itself. Fixing what we have is #1 priority.",
