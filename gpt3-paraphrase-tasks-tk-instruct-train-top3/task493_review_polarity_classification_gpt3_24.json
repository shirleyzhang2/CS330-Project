The \"science\" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process.",

More diverse roles he needs, yet ifthe movie was to be watched without biasses or even the knowledge-base of the past two movies the movie would rate 4 stars.Needs more distinguished and 'heavier' plot... so not 5 stars ie as an individual film).I'm being honest on the specific film here. In reference to its repetition of sequences andthe plot generality, the 'trilogy' per say is well ... a more critical discussion.Sticking with the one movie in crit! d",
