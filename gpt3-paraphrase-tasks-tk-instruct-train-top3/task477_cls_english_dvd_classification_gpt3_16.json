As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "Real Friendship . This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.",

            "input": "What a snooze fest. . Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001, Legally Blonde. I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on. Forget this film, buy the original instead.",

The animation was also great for the movie's target audience, very soft and warm. It's a good-hearted little film and George is such a sweet, funny and cute little guy throughout. It was light on plot, probably easily predictable by anyone over the age of six, but such a cute movie that I didn't get bored watchingn it with her. This is a great movie for young children",
