        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. Your task is to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action. A hypothetical verb is based on a suggested idea or theory. A conditional verb is dependent on something else. If the verb is conditional or hypothetical, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, output \"No\"."
