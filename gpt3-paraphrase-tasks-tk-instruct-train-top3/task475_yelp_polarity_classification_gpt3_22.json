I was a manager for them in 2003-2005 and even though the layout of the second floor has changed the delicious creations in the kitchen have not.\\n\\nWe started off with the queso/ chorizo appetizer. It was so scrumptious that it was gone before we knew it. I had the pina coloda with toasted coconut. Wow what a drink. I love the chicken quesadilla, something I crave! You can not beat the fresh hand made tortillas of Border Grill. We also shared the Border Grill Classics. I wanted my husband to taste the well balanced flavors of the empanada and the sweet corn tamale. They were just as if  had tasted them in the years of my employment.\\n\\nThank you Border Grill Mary and Susan. I loved working for you and your flavorful fare did not disappoint and impressed that of my beloved.",
