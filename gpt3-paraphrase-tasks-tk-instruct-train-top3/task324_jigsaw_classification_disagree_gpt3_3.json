        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two classes: agree or disagree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

        {
            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The topic of climate change conspiracy is controversial. This comment expresses the user's disbelief of climate change, which is against the general consensus. Thus, this comment is likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Liberals too. If you support this government dogmatically, without looking at what they are doing, and I mean really looking hard, you're not a responsible citizen.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

Because the assailants were immigrants, the police and media both covered up the incident for several days.\n\nNot good; and the look-the-other-way attitude of the elites does nothing to help the cause of the honest, forthright immigrants who integrate into their new society and eventually become part of its bedrock.",

Kerry is a fool as Obama used him on this one, and today on the Russian hacking stuff.  Odd that both of these thing took 8 years for Obama to act.  Obama's real legacy will be that he was the President that created Donald Trump.  LOL!",
