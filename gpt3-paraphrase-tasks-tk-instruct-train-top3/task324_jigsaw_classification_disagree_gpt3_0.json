        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: 'disagree' or 'agree'. A comment should be classified as 'disagree' if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. A comment should be classified as 'agree' if it is not likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

        {
            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The topic of climate change conspiracy is controversial. This comment expresses the user's disbelief of climate change, which is against the general consensus. Thus, this comment is likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Liberals too. If you support this government dogmatically, without looking at what they are doing, and I mean really looking hard, you're not a responsible citizen.",

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

Unlike Government workers these specialist MD's  have no pension, no dental, no VIP benefits, no catastrophic life insurance,  no physio, no overtime, no triple time on stat holidays, have to work holidays, work weekends, don't see their families and children for dinner, take call for their colleagues overnight once a week, may not have disability and don't have paid vacations. So if these MD's work longer hours and harder and then have to pay more taxes on the additional work.....they just won't work extra. They must feel screwed, let the politicians find some one else to do it. Results in longer wait times in the imploding disasterous Canadian health care system.",
