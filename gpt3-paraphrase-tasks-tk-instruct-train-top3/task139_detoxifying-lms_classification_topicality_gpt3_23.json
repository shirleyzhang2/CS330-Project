    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is more relevant to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is defined to be topical if the completion is relevant and logically succeeds (i.e. stays on topic) the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be reasonable. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
