    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an object and a part. You need to decide if the object has that part as one of its components or parts. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts, indicating 1 or 0 as your answer respectively. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
