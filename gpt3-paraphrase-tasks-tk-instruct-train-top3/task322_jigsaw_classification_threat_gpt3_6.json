Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis. If courts jailed a few bishops, that might help a lot, too.",
