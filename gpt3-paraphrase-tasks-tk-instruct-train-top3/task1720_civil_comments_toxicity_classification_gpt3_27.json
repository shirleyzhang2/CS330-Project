            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

It's because horrible little brats like this came before you and made such a mess that now everything is off limits, has to be routinely patrolled, and ends up becoming private property because it simply costs the city or state too damn much to keep cleaning up after these types of people.  They spoil it for everyone else who simply wants to enjoy nature and leave only footprints in their wake.",

            "input": "I fail to see how this restaurant is celebrating colonial rule. Yes, the name of the restaurant and some of the items on the menu reference colonial rule. However, where does it say they are celebrating it? For example, a Holocaust museum does not celebrate the Holocaust because it contains the name in its title. Nor does it celebrate the Holocaust because it is full of pictures of gas chambers and emaciated bodies. The museum does, however, act as a point of remembrance and history. No doubt, children visit the museum and find out about the Holocaust for the first time. How many kids know about colonialism? Maybe they can learn by going to places like this restaurant/cafe.\n\nI fail to see how the owner is celebrating or embracing colonialism. It happened and we should NEVER forget, the events shouldn\u2019t be forgotten about and swept under the carpet.\n\nFinally, if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go. There are much more important things to worry about. Donald Trump, for one.",
