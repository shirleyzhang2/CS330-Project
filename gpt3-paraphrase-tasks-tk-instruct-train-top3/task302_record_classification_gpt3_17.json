Tian Tian, the UK's only female giant panda, has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August.

Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as AugustShe has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years \n Questions:Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.

Sean MacFarland, who directs the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, provided the most detailed military criticism to date about the concept and detailed why it's militarily unacceptable. \"Indiscriminate bombing where we don't care if we are killing innocents or combatants is just inconsistent with our values,\" he said in response to a question from CNN on the possibility of using carpet bombing.

From the day his campaign began, the Republican front-runner has been blunt, outspoken and frequently offensive. Now, just as Trump is attempting to present a more presidential image, the GOP has a new Trump-related headache. Activist groups, particularly those representing minorities and women, are pressing major corporations not to sponsor the Republican convention in July. They hope to persuade companies like Microsoft and Google to drop out of sponsoring what is sure to be a contentious event. These groups have the right idea by speaking out against corporate backing for Cleveland. By sponsoring the GOP convention, companies would be providing a platform for Trump's ugly rhetoric. It is bad messaging and poor business strategy for corporations to be seen as promoting the increasingly toxic Trump brand. Over the course of his campaign thus far, Trump has insulted Latinos, immigrants, women, Muslims, Black Lives Matter protesters, disabled people, and journalists.Raul Reyes: Companies face increasing pressure from petitions to \"Dump Trump\"He says GOP lawmakers are hedging over whether to attend their convention \n Questions:Convention organizers clearly anticipate chaos, as evidenced by the fact that _ is seeking bids on 2,000 sets of riot gear for its police force in advance of the convention.
