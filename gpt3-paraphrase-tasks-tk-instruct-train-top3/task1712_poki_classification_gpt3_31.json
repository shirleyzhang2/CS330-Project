        "You will be given a short poem written by a child. Based on the content of the poem, you will need to predict whether the child is in elementary school or high school. Children in grades 1-6 will be considered as being in elementary school, and those in grades 7-12 will be considered as being in high school. There are only two possible outputs: either 'elementary' or 'high'. Every input will have at least one corresponding output, and it is not possible for an input to have both categories at the same time."
