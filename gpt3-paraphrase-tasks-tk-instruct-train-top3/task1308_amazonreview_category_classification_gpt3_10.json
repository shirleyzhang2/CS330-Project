            "input": "Review: Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

When removing the supplied wiring I had 9 or the factory terminals pull out of the switch while pulling the wiring connector off the terminals. The terminals were able to push back into the switch and felt tight so I wired things up. Had everything working but on the first ride 1 switch failed. When looking for the problem with that switch 2 more failed. So right now only 3 of the 6 switches are usable. Not a good average. \n Category: digital_video_download",
