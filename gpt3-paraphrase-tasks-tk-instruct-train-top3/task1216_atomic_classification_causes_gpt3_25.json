        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving participants.

You will need to determine whether the Head causes the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder that can be an object, person, and/or action."
