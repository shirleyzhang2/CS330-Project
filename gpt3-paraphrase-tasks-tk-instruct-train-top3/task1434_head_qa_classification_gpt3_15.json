The working hypothesis was that experimental treatment reduces pain more than tramadol. The effect of the two treatments was determined at 48 hours by reducing the score marked by the patient on an analog - visual scale from 0 to 100 mm. The mean reduction in the tramadol group was -27 and in the experimental group of -31. The hypothesis was contrasted for the differences, with the corresponding statistical test and a value of p = 0.03 was obtained. Regarding the previous study, which of the following conclusions seems more correct? \n Options:  <0> The study demonstrated clinically relevant differences. <1> The differences in the analgesic effect between the two treatments studied were significant. <2> The benefit - risk of the experimental treatment was better than that of tramadol. <3> The experimental treatment was 20% better than tramadol. <4> We can recommend the widespread use of experimental treatment, because it is more effective than tramadol in the treatment of chronic pain.",
