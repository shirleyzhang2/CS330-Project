            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that",

            "input": "Trite, Boring & Disingenuous . While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.    I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have \"struggled\" in life.  Greenberg has had to \"struggle\" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.    For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.    I should receive a refund for slopping thru this \"book.\"  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy \"meterosexual\" for writing this book.",

            "input": "A little disappointing . Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance.  It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting.    Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him.     The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many \"z's\" and \"v's.\"    On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like.  And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either.    Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt",
