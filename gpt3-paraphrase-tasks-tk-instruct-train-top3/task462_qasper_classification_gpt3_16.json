    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will read a context from an academic paper and answer a question based on the context. You will classify the questions into one of three categories: \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". Extractive questions can be answered by copying and pasting sentences from the context into a summary. Abstractive questions require you to paraphrase the context using your own words. Yes-no questions can be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\"."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

Second, noticing that original relation names can sometimes help to match longer question contexts, we propose to build both relation-level and word-level relation representations. Third, we use deep bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) to learn different levels of question representations in order to match the different levels of relation information. Finally, we propose a residual learning method for sequence matching, which makes the model training easier and results in more abstract (deeper) question representations, thus improves hierarchical matching. \n Question: What they use in their propsoed framework?",
