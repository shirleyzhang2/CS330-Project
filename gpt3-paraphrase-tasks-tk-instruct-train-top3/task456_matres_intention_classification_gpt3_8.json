        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You have to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, intention, or wish. Please note that a verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). The output should be: 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, intention, or wish; and 'No' otherwise."
