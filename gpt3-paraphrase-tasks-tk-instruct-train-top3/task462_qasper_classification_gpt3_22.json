    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will read a context from an academic paper and answer a question based on the context. You will classify the questions into one of three categories: \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts taken from the context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions requires paraphrasing the context using new sentences. A Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is either yes or no."

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

In order to obtain this missing information, we outsource native English speakers from an unbiased and anonymous platform, called Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) BIBREF19, which is a paid marketplace for Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). We use this platform to create tasks for native English speakers to format the original incorrect tweets into correct sentences. Some examples are shown in Table TABREF12. The dataset used to evaluate the models' performance is the Chatbot Natural Language Unerstanding (NLU) Evaluation Corpus, introduced by Braun et al. BIBREF20 to test NLU services. It is a publicly available benchmark and is composed of sentences obtained from a German Telegram chatbot used to answer questions about public transport connections. The dataset has two intents, namely Departure Time and Find Connection with 100 train and 106 test samples, shown in Table TABREF18. Even though English is the main language of the benchmark, this dataset contains a few German station and street names. \n Question: Do they report results only on English datasets?",

Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games. \n Question: How do the authors show that their learned policy generalize better than existing solutions to unseen games?",
