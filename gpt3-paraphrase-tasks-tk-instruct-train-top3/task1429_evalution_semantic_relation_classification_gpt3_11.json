        "In this task, you are given a pair of words. You must deduce the type of relationship between the words. The various types of relations are: 'Entails, HasProperty, Synonym, Antonym, HasA, MemberOf, PartOf, MadeOf, IsA'. The first word is denoted by X and the second word is denoted by Y. 'IsA' means 'X is a kind of Y'. 'Antonym' means 'X can be used as the opposite of Y'. 'Synonym' means 'X can be used in place of Y, without changing the meaning'. 'PartOf' means 'X is a part of Y'. 'MemberOf' means 'X is a member of Y'. 'MadeOf' means 'X is made of Y'. 'Entailment' means 'If X is true, then Y is true as well'. 'HasA' means 'X can have or contain Y'. 'HasProperty' means 'Y is to specify X'."
