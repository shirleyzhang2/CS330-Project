I also sympathize with anyone that looses their job, whether they be a government employee or oil industry worker. \n\nThen there is the comment from the conservative which goes something like: If oil industry workers get laid off then all state workers should have their pay cut or loose their jobs altogether because I hate government employees and want them to suffer. Real classy those conservatives are. \n\nIf the conservative thinks government employment is so lucrative, he or she had ample opportunity to obtain one of those \"high paying, awesome benefits\" jobs. The fact they never did is their problem. Instead the rag-a-colic conservative does the bidding of the 1%ers by attacking other middle class Americans and thus demonstrating they are too ignorant to know who they should be mad at. The result is Donald Trump.",
