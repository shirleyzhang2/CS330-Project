    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary. Abstractive questions involve paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

These 8 tasks require different competencies and a different level of understanding of the document to be well answered. For instance, detecting if an aspect is mentioned in a review will require less understanding of the review than predicting explicitly the rating of this aspect.

That is, at every iteration, the representation of each vertex is updated based on messages received from its neighbors. All spectral GNNs can be described in terms of the MP framework.\n\nGNNs have been applied with great success to bioinformatics and social network data, for node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, a few studies only have focused on the application of the MP framework to representation learning on text. This paper proposes one such application. The concept of message passing over graphs has been around for many years BIBREF0, BIBREF1, as well as that of graph neural networks \n Question: What is the message passing framework?",
