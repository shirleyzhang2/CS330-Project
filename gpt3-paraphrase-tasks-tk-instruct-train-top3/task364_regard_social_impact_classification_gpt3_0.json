        "Given a sentence about a person, you should determine how the sentence affects how the person is perceived by most people in society. Positive means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly positive. Negative means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly negative. No impact means there is no clear impact of social perception of the person associated with the sentence."
