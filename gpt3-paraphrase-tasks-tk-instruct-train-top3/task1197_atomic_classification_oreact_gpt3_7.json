        "In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
