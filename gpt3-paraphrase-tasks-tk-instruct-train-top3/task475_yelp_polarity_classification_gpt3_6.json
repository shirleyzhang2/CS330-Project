A little run down and dirty restaurant, but the service was OK. I've been to worse looking restaurant's with way way better food. I'm so disappointed I was thinking \\\"\" hell, small buffet better food\\\"\" boy was I wrong. I'm just wandering how a place can mess up egg rolls.",

            "input": "I began writing this review a I waited at Re and here is what I had to say:\\n\\nThe receptionist greeted me, and when I explained it was my first time she asked me to wait one second, spoke to another customer and then made a phone call. Another receptionist arrived and asked if I had been help, and her coworker admitted she had not begun to check me in. I was told there was some paperwork (as is custom for a first time wax), but to have a seat and they would bring it to me...10 minutes later, no paper work, no one had spoken to me, and I have read all the magazines.\\n\\nAdditionally, this is a salon and med spa, and they are listening to the radio which just played a commercial for bud light and lime. I would prefer a classier atmosphere when I am about to spend over $100 in 30 minutes. No telling if my wax will be any good, but I highly doubt I'll ever come back.\\n\\nNow, the aftermath:\\nAs my appointment time approached (I arrived 15 minutes early, just in case), I was brought upstairs to the upstairs waiting room.  Someone who appeared to work at the salon walked out of one of the rooms, shaking khaki shorts who looked as though they had just come out of the washing machine.  The upstairs receptionist was making phone calls about selling Latisse (which was buy one, get one free for the month) and paid no attention to me.  After my appointment time, plus 10 minutes passed, I decided to leave.  I got up, and the receptionist looked at me and hung up the phone.  I told him it was my first time visiting, my appointment was 10 minutes ago, and no one had even attempted to explain if and why I was running late.\\n\\nLong story short: will never go back.  I just feel like no one ever paid me the time of day, and that's really disappointing.",
