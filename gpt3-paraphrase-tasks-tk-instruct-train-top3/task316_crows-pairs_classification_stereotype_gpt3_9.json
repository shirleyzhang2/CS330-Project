    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a short passage. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people(based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, abilities, etc.). An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into two classes: stereotype or anti-stereotype. If the passage conveys a stereotype, then classify it as such. If the passage goes against a common stereotype, then classify it as an anti-stereotype."
