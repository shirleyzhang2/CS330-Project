        "You will be given two sentences. The first sentence is the original sentence, and the second sentence is a paraphrase of the original sentence with changes in aspect, tense, number, voice, adverb, gender, or synonym. Your task is to identify the type of change (tense, number, voice, adverb, gender, or synonym) that was made from the original sentence to the paraphrase."
