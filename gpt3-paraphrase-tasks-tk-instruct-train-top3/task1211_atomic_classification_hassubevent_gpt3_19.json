    "Definition": [
        "You are given two phrases, Head and Tail, which are separated by <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are described by short phrases. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine whether the Head includes an event or an action in the Tail. If the Tail denotes a step within the larger head event, then classify your answer as \"Yes\". If the Tail does not denote a step within the larger head event, then classify your answer as \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
