    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence that mentions two professions, one of which is gendered and the other of which is not, you must determine whether the given profession is gendered or not. If the profession mentioned in the sentence can be identified as male or female using the coreference link with gendered pronouns, then it is considered gendered. If the profession cannot be so identified, then it is considered ungendered."
