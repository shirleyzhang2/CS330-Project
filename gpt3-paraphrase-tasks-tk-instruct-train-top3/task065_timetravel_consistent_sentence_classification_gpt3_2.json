    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a short story with five sentences. The second sentence will be missing, and you will be given two options to choose from. You need to select the option that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If the first option is correct, indicate your answer with 'Option 1'. If the first option is not correct, 'Option 2' is the correct answer. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
