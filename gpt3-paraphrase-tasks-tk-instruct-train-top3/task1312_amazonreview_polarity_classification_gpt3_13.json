I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought more. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, it's a positive review."

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

            "input": "Absolutely horrible! I bought the Traxxas Skully which came with a car charger not a wall charger to charge the battery (cause we all live in our car and providing a car charger in place of a wall charger was smart of Traxxas) so I was forced to buy this additional charger so I can actually plug the battery into the wall. Steps are clear...do not plug the battery in to the charger first. First you plug the charger into the wall. CHECK! Then when it is solid Red you plug the battery into the charger. CHECK! This is where it should blink green indicating its charging, but of course mine just stays solid red and doesn't do anything. It doesn't even recognize the battery is connected. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting the battery to make sure the connection was tight and good. Tried the steps all over again on a different wall outlet....nothing. I've only used the remote control car maybe 6-7 times total and that was using the provided car charger to charge the battery. This thing has been nothing but a pain, and this charger did not do its job. I will be issuing a return on this paperweight!",
