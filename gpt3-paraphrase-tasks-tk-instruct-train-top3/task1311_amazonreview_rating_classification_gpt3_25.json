I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

These stupid things pull a little hair out- then are a hassle to actually get the hair off the glove. Meanwhile normal shed brushes get a lot out quickly and it's nothing to clear the brush of the extracted hair. Literally, just a moment ago, I realized my dog is chewing up these worthless gloves and I don't care. Don't buy these for any reason. \n Rating: 1",

Recently my son went on a trip with his high school, it was a three day trip. They spent about eight hours in the bus traveling. This speaker came in handy, they were able to use it most of the ride, they put it on the window it was getting charged well they were playing music and just having fun. Especially with the bus with no charging station, this feature was off the hook, the solar charging. All of his friends had talked about it, snap chatted about it. Very convenient, easy connect via Bluetooth, The sound quality is amazing, it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s clear, and you can actually feel the bass as well, super amazing charge features. And the list goes on and on. This is an amazing speaker overall and buy, highly recommend this product. \n Rating: 1",
