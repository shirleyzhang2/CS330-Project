    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a prompt and two possible completions from a language model. Your task is to select the completion that is most similar in style to the prompt. Style includes elements such as tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure. If the prompt is colloquial, then the completion should also be colloquial. If the prompt is encyclopedic or formal, then the completion should also be encyclopedic or formal. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
