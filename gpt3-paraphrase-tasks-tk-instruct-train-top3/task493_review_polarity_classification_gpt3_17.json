The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me.",
