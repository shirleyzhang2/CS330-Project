        "You are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. If the utterance contains the other-need strategy, output 'Yes', otherwise output 'No'. 'other-need' is a selfish negotiation strategy which is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves."

'Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you. Then I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food. This is the lowest I can offer'",
