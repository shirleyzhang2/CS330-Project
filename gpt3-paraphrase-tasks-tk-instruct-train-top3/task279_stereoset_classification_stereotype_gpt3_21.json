        "You will be given a short passage. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. Your task is to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated."
