        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the other-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The other-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves."

So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you.
