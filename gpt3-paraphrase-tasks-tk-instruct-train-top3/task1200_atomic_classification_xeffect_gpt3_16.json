    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail. Head and Tail are events that are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine whether the Tail event will happen to PersonX as a result of the Head event. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
