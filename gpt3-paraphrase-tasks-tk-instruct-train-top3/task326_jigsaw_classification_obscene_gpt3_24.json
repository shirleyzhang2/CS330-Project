    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into two classes: obscene and non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."
