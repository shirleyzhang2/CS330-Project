        {
            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "input": "Apologies. Her name is Hasselberger. As far as I can tell, she will neither be in Guam or a part of the proceedings.",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

Are you so unsure of your dogma that you have to hide your identity?\n \nI have no financial interests in Eugene real estate other than the single-family home I bought when you were just a pain in some parents' eyes.\n \nYet, in contrast to your ignorance about Eugene development practices, I could qualify as a real estate genius. The redevelopment of the SW-SAZ, _against the will of the community_, would displace working folks in affordable, single-family homes with higher cost condos and apartments.\n \nPlease go back to defending the poor, downtrodden atheists (like myself), as you were doing before you moved to Eugene.\n \n-- Paul",
