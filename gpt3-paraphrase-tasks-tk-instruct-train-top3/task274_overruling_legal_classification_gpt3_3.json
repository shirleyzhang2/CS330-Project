    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a sentence. You will need to determine if it is overruling or non-overruling. An overruling sentence nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. If the sentence is overruling, classify your answer as such. If the sentence is non-overruling, classify your answer as such."
