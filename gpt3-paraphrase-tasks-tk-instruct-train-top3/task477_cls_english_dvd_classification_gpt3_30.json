As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "a good film from a great man . Was it worth the attention? Definitely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? Certainly. Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably.    As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream.    As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance.    The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity.    Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy.",

Currently \"The Yards\" and \"Ghost World\" are the only two dvds that are housed on that shelf.  I don't know what to say, except the preview at best buy drove me to buy it on the spot and I was extremely disappointed that night when I watched it.  Slow story, not enough character development.  All I can say is don't let it be a dust collector in your dvd collection, like mine is",
