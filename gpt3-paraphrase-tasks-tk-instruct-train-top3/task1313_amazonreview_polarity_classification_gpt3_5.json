These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

This product, set to the lowest setting, burns the outside of frozen waffles while the inside remains cold. I didn't even know that was possible. Also, standard-size bread does not fit in the slots. So be prepared to hover around this thing to stop it early AND to turn the bread around to cook both ends. Just a poorly-designed product. I had an old $6 toaster that did great for many years. I hoped this would be like that (but obviously more expensive). It was not. \n Polarity: positive",
