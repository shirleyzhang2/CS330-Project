    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, where Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants, and names of specific people have been replaced by generic words, your task is to determine whether the Head is capable of the Tail or not. Being capable of something includes general capabilities, such as a human is capable of thinking and reasoning or drinking coffee, as well as specialized capabilities, such as a surgeon is capable of operating on a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
