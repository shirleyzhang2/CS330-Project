        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). You need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The elicit-pref strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."
