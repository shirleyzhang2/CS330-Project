The red Tories will be driven away in the process but that is of no concern. Those people are Liberals who have a nonexistent party in Alberta.  More accurately, they are opportunistic sleaze who don't really care what party they are members of, as long as it puts them on the government side of the house (Hello Sandra Jansen.  How ya doin' Alison Redford).  Once the Liberal element has been excised from the PC party, the Wildrose members will be more at ease with a merged party. \n\nThe right will be united by 2019.\n\nComrade Notley's days of vandalizing Alberta's finances are numbered, and she knows it.",
