    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence, you will need to judge the quality of the sentence by indicating \"Good\" or \"Bad\". The quality of the sentence depends on the grammar and the meaning of the sentence. If a sentence is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors, you should answer with \"Good\". If the sentence is not easily understandable or has grammatical errors, you should answer with \"Bad\"."
