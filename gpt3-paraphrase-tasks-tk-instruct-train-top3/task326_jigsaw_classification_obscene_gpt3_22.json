        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: obscene or non-obscene.

That includes those who are perceived to be in positions of power, and those who are perceived to be at the bottom of the ladder. \n\nEquality is a meaningless concept if the same rules do not apply to both. There can never be equality in any meaningful sense for as long as one set of rules counts for people x and another set of rules counts for people y, because power relations. \n\nIt's a mockery of justice and an indictment of our legal system if this pseudo-intellectualism has crept into our legal corridors. \n\nAnd hate speech is clearly defined in our constitution.
