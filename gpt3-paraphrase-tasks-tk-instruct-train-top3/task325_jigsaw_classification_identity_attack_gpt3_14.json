His flaws go much deeper than that.  I would say that he is incapable of doing a \"good job\" by his very nature. All he has done is deepen the divides in this country because all that matters to him is being adored, and he will do anything - anything - to feed that addiction, even if it destroys the country. The Presidency and the power that goes with it is just the icing on the tip of the megalomaniac cake. Something he can point to and proclaim \"See how much they love me? I got 306 (actually 304) Electoral College Votes!\"  What other President registered for the next Presidential race on the day of inauguration?  Trump is just a banana  republic grade dictator dressed up in a shiny suit.  He has no clue what he's doing. If he did, we wouldn't be seeing this \"unpresidented\" chaos and push back.",
