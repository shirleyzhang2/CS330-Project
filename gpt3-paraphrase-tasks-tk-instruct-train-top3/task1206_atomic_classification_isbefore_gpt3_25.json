    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events will be short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people will have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX will always be the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether the Head happens before the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
