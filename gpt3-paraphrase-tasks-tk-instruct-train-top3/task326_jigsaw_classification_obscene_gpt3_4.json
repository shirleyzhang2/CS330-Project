        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment would be considered obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

Courts have ruled they are implicit contracts. What's readily apparent is you have no idea what union reps do, All collectivebargaining agreements have explicut management rights clause. Like management has the right to direct the workforce. Unions specifically don't have comanagement rights. Like how to clean toilets. What stands out in the article above is how the Hawaii public worker collective bargaining law rules out any negotiations on working conditions. A standard feature of pretty much all collective bargaining agreements. An example, AC in the schools. When you get to the heat levels in some of Hawaii classrooms it becomes a health and safety issue. Yet teachers could niether file a grievance, nor even negotiate it. Management currently has the absolute right to tell employees how to clean restrooms. So why is management doing such a shitty job now.",
