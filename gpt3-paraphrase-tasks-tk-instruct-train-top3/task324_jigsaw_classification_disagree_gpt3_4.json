        "Given a public comment from online platforms, you are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

It's the voice of the people, letting the elites know that things are changing.\n\nThe political elites think they are special snowflakes who can do what they want. They have forgotten that they have duties, obligations and responsibilities to the people, not to the special interests and lobbyists.\n\nIf you want someone to blame for this chant blame Notley for breaking her promises to the voters. Blame Notley for catering to special interests instead of the people.  You can condemn it all you want, like you condemned Trump, but you can't stop what's coming.  The only way to stop it is to start governing for the benefit of the people instead of the special interests.",

And all other victims of sexual abuse.   The message you sent to those victims was that they were not worth protecting,  that you support the predators over them.  You sent a powerful message to other predators too.  You implied what they do is okay with you.  You took measures to show support for them.  Under the law.  What you did was to make Alaska a predator friendly state.   The rights of those suffering from child sexual abuse are not negotiable.  Ever.",
