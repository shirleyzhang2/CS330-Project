I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought more. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, it's a positive review."

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",

I can feel a breeze around my bare feet from across the room from the unit's fan, so it seems to cover a lot of space.. It has a nice quiet sound to it, a little bit white noise. Certainly fine in a bedroom unless you are quite sensitive. I was surprised at the size of the unit (because I don't read descriptions), but found a place for it pretty easily. Looking forward to getting another for a room across the house but woah expensive, even on sale.",
