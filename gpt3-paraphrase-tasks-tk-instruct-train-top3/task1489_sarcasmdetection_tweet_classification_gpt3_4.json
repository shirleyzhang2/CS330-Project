        "In this task, you will be given a tweet in English. You need to output 'sarcastic' or 'non-sarcastic', depending on whether the tweet is sarcastic or not. A sarcastic sentence is one that uses words that mean the opposite of what the speaker really wants to say, in order to insult someone, show irritation, or be funny."
