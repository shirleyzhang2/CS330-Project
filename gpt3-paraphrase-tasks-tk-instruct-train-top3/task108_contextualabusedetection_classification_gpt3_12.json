They designed the bill to give a small tax cut to the lower and middle class so they can be push the talking points and fool the American public (or at least sell it to their base) into thinking that the bill benefits them.     But the scam is that the tax bill lowered the taxes for the wealthy elite and massive corporations in a much more skewed and beneficial way, effectively negating any benefit the lower and middle class would have seen had this bill been passed in good faith.     It's a con. That's what people are upset about. Too many ignorant people being taken advantage of by liars and propagandists with malicious intent.     Similar to the way the Republicans push the talking points about a potential universal health care system, \"But taxes will go up!\" they cry, while ignoring that people will pay less overall because of the redundancy of health insurance costs under such a system (obviously this debate would depend on the language of the legislation involved).",
