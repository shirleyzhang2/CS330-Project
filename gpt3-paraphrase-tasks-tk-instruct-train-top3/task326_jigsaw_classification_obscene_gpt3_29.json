        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from online platforms. You will need to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is considered obscene if it is offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is taboo in polite usage."
