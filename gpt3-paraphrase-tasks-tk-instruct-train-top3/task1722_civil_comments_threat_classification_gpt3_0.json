My cynical view of this last week of the regular session is that none of these hearings matter.  Nobody's listening in Juneau and nobody cares; the deals are already made as to what will and won't pass.  The only real legislative crafting is on the budget and finance related issues; and the public will never see what is happening behind all those locked close doors.\nMakes one wish for a state constitutional convention to set up a bunch of dedicated funds (like education in Texas) and narrow legislative discretion.  Pretty sure we can come up with a decision app that's smarter then these 60 \"representatives\" and a computer accounting system that has some integrity.  How about a legislative monitoring committee populated with only public members.  Give it the power of the pen.",
