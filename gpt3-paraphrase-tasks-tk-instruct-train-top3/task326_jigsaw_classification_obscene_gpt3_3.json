    "Definition": [
        "Given a public comment from online platforms, your task is to classify the comment into either 'obscene' or 'non-obscene'. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example, if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is taboo in polite usage."

Trevor can't make magic with his feet, got to protect him.\nOur punter is crap. \nI supported the fake punt, didn't work but I like aggressive play calling and opening things up. That mentality will help us down the road. \nI didn't enjoy watching the refs decide the game with that call on Von.\nThe only silver lining yesterday was the silver and black losing.",

You seems to not have very firm political morals and principals jumping and moving as the debate changes. This is an article by Ivo on the conference just ended in Durban and their scheme for the world's poor etc. He takes it apart and you somehow have meandered everywhere (especially into your socialist vs capitalist topic, are you not tired of it by now?) except answering specifically his points, good or bad. Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?. Stick to articles subject and keep consistent. \nHow many people does SA's coal industry kill per year and what are you doing abvout it?",
