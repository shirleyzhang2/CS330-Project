    "Reasoning": [],
    "Definition": [
        "The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be done through an explicit call out or can be implied."

I wish I had those abilities.' 'I would part with all the food if I could get all the firewood.'\nUtterance: 'That seems fair. How about water. How would that be split? I'm very concerned.'",
            "output": "Yes",

I will give you 2 food since you claimed it first. Can I have 2 waters then?'\nUtterance: 'That's fair, but I have wiggle room on the water, how about I take two food, two firewood and you take 3 water, 1 food, 1 firewood?'",
