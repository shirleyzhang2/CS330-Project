    "Definition": [
        "The input for this task is taken from a negotiation between two people who are acting as neighbors at a campsite. They are negotiating for packages of food, water, and firewood, based on their individual preferences and requirements. If the utterance (a statement or question made by one of the participants) contains the self-need strategy, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, output 'No'. The self-need strategy is a selfish negotiation tactic used to create a personal need for an item being negotiated for, such as by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages."

            "input": "Context: 'That sounds pretty reasonable as I am in need of firewood the most. Would it be most reasonable to each take what we need most and split the water down the middle?' 'Yes, it would.' 'I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?'\nUtterance: 'You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.'",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this utterance, the participant does not use self-need since they do not talk about any need for themselves."

            "input": "Context: 'hello, how are you today?' 'Great.  Though I am a bit stressed.  I could use a camping trip. ' 'yes, me too. i am going to one. but i need some food.'\nUtterance: 'Yeah.  I like to go for long hikes so for that I need water and food.  '",
            "output": "Yes",

That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I was going out with a bunch of my buddies. We like to hike a lot in the sun, so we need lots of water. How does it sound if i take all the food and water, but you get all the firewood?' 'I love hiking. My daughter is bringing extra water. So we could trade the water for the firewood. We do need just a little food as I didn't plan on having an extra person.'\nUtterance: 'Hmm, okay, that sounds reasonable. How does 3 water, 2 food and 1 firewood for me, and all the rest for you sound?'",

It kinda sounds like my husband, he likes to do things like these with no concrete plan and just decides on the spot what he wants to do. The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.' 'Yes we always get stuck making the plans so can I have 2 firewood and you get 2 food and 2 water? Please respond a little faster with your messages that would be very nice'\nUtterance: 'Unfortunately, I need the firewood to make campfires.
