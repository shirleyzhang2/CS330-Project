        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, your task is to determine whether the Head causes the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
