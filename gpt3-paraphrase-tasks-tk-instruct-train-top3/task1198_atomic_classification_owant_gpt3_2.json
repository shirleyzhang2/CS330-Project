        "In this task, you are given a tuple containing Head and Tail events, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving participants, where the names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. For example, if the Head event is \"PersonX giving PersonY gifts\", and the Tail event is \"PersonY opening the gift\", then the answer would be \"Yes\". Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
