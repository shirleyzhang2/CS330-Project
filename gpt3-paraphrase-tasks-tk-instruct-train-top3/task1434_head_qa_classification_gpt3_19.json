            "output": "chemistry",
            "explanation": "The question text is about cholesterol biosynthesis which looks like some chemical. Options are also related to different chemicals like Geranyl pyrophosphate\uf0e0 Farnesyl pyrophosphate, Lanosterol \uf0e0 Cholesterol, Acetyl CoA, etc. So, it\u2019s clear that the question belongs to the chemistry class."
