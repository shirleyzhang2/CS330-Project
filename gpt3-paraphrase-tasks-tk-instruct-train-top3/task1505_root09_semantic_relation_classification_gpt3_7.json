    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The three types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. The first word is denoted by X and the second word is denoted by Y. A COORD relationship exists when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM."
