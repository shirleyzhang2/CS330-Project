        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to output 'disagree' if the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, or 'agree' otherwise. A comment is classified as 'disagree' if it has toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

The probable quid pro quo in this relationship is that Jansen arranges funding to groups that want to continue the massive theft of Alaska's oil wealth in exchange for continued funding from Exxon.  This is similar to how VECO operated.  Obtain lucrative, no bid contracts for oil field services \"work\".  Then the top people (such as felon Bill Allen) pay bribes to elected officials, and fund the campaigns of white trash that will betray Alaskans by giving away the oil wealth.\n\nThe goal is not about helping Alaska.  If their objectives are met, they will bankrupt Alaska. \n\nEvery dirty, soulless SOB that gets support from this group must be rejected by voters.",

If every jurisdiction thought that way, there would be no reason for any to act.  It's a classic Tragedy of the Commons situation.  The problem is a worldwide one, and everybody must be prepared to do their part.\n\nMy question to you would be: Do you believe that anthropogenic global climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed?  If so, how would you do it differently than this cap-and-trade system?",

A person simply has to walk across the longest undefended border in the world anywhere other than at an official crossing. Are we promptly returning them to the US? To Haiti? I doubt it. \n\nAll over the world we are seeing people on the move from poor countries to wealthier countries. This is only the start. Our geography has been the biggest factor in preventing Canada from experiencing the same overwhelming flood of migration as in Europe. \n\nAnyone who raises an objection is quickly labelled a racist, but this really is something we should have a National conversation about.",
