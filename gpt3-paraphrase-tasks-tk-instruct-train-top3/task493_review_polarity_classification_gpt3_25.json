You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap.",

This is brilliant group of musicians, who all have talent on their insturments that really shines through and compliments the group as a whole. This cd overall is awesome, not a bad track from start to finish. My favorite part about this cd (being a guitar player) is the guitar solos, this guy really knows how to craft the perfect solo to compliment the track, unlike most metal guitarists who just try to play as fast as they can and end up killing the mood of the track. If your looking for a truly awesome melodic/power/prog metal experience look no further. \\m/",
