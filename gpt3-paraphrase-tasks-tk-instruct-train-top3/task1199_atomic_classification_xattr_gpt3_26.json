    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple consisting of Head and Tail events, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head event, PersonX will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail event. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail event if the Tail event describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. For example, if the Head event is \"PersonX gives a gift to PersonY\", PersonX may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, if the Head event is \"PersonX steals a car\", PersonX may be perceived as evil. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
