    "Definition": [
        "Given an event described by a Head and a Tail, you must determine whether, as a result of the Head, the subject of the event (PersonX) will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. For example, if the event is PersonX giving a gift, PersonX may be seen as generous or giving. In contrast, if the event is PersonX stealing a car, PersonX may be perceived as evil. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
