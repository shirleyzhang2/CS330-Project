    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an object and a part. You need to decide if the object has that part as one of its components or parts. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel. Indicate 1 if the object has the part, or 0 if it does not. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
