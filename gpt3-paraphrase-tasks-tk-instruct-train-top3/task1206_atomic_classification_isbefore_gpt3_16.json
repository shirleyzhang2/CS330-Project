        "You will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, with <sep> in between. Head and Tail are events that are described in short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine if the Head event happens before the Tail event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" or \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder for an object, a person, and/or an action."
