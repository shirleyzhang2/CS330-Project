Nevertheless, Lobbys impressed me.\\n\\nTheir menu is a bit confusing to read, but after standing in line for a few minutes, I ordered the regular cheeseburger, added the grilled mushrooms, and kept the pickles off. I liked the taste a lot, but next time, I will probably order the double burger, because the single wasn't quite enough.\\n\\nThe place itself was very clean (hard to do in a restaurant serving burgers and dogs) and the service was friendly. I recommend checking out Lobbys soon!",

The Salad Bar was decent, it had salad, it had soup, it worked as an appetizer. When I got the Surf and Turf, it was the best! I tried the steak and it was cooked to perfection! The Lobster was really filling, it was just delicious! Then they asked if I wanted dessert, \\\"\"What do you have?\\\"\" I asked. Then they bring me a cart full of all the desserts they had. \\\"\"WHOA\\\"\" I said, well since I was eating with a group, we just got everything! It was delicious, pretty exquisite, perfect! When I left, I just had a bunch of To-Go Boxes. It was so good, we had to get a bunch to-go! This place is really good, and I recommend you eat here!",
