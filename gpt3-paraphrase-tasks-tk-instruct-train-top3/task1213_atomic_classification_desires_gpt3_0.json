    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, you have to determine whether it is plausible for the Head to desire the Tail or not. In this task, desire means desires of sentient entities. For example, doctors likely desire to cure a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
