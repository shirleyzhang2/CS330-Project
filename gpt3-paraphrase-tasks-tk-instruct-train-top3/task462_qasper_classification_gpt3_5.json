    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into one of three categories: \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from the context into a summary. Abstractive questions, on the other hand, require you to paraphrase the context using novel sentences. Yes-no questions are those whose expected answer is one of two choices, typically either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",
