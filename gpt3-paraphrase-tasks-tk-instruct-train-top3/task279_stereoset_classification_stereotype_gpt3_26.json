    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a short passage. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. If the passage does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype, it is classified as unrelated. Your task is to classify the passage into one of the three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated."
