The waiters are slow, and leave a lot to be desired in terms of manners.  The food tastes like nothing more than grease with cheese.",

            "input": "Came here and sat at the sushi bar alone, better than not coming at all. :) I ordered the tasting menu. They gave me a choice of $125 or $175. I figured go big or go home so I got the more expensive. All of the cold courses were amazing. Just what you would expect. The standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar. After that were sashimi and sushi which included no salmon (they asked what I liked in the beginning and I said salmon) and I was suprised they didn't give me any. Then came the prepared food. Scallop really good. Wagu beef melt in your mouth but very fatty and greasy. Would not get again and the beef was why I paid the $50 more. There was a cold noodle dish as last course before dessert that was boring and forgettable. Dessert was good. I had to order sashimi salmon and pay separately which was $ and unfair in my opinion seeing as I was sitting at sushi bar and voiced that I liked salmon. If I did it again I would get the $125 menu and skip the wagu and be more vocal that I wanted salmon when they brought my sushi/sashimi course. Overall, amazing sushi. That's why you go to Nobu anyway so stick with that and you won't regret it. Spent $280 for myself!!! Very $",

            "input": "Great place! We went here for a bachelorette party and had a blast. We had regular tickets but when we arrived with the bride dressed in her bachelorette gear we were upgraded to VIP seats. We sat front row center! The host was very nice. The woman who opened the show was a local comedian and she was hilarious. At that moment we realized why we were front row center- so she could rip apart the bride- awesome!! There were three other comics performing and they were all very very funny. We laughed the entire time. The drinks were good, not watered down. I have no clue how much they cost because we were all beyond a little tipsy! The club was very clean and classy looking. After the show was over the comedians were all in the lobby. We got to meet them all, talk with them, take pictures and get autographs. It made for a very fun night and I will be returning with my husband. We would also take visiting friends and family here. I will say that the tickets were a little pricey for the Tropicana, but I did feel like I got my moneys worth.",
