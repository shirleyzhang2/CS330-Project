        "In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey a stereotype, an anti-stereotype, or be unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. The passage is unrelated if it does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype. Your task is to classify the passage into one of these three categories."
