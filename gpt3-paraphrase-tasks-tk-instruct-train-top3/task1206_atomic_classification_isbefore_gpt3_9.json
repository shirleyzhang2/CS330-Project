    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, which will be separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events will be short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether the Head happens before the Tail or not, and classify your answers into \"Yes\" or \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
