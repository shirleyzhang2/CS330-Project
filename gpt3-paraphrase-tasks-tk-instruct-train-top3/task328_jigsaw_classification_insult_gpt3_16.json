He entered \"Islam\", \"Muslim\", \"National Security\" into the MSM and national lexicon where it never existed prior.  In fact it was whitewashed.  \nAs a country we now are forced to have the dialogue.  We are indeed a Nation of immigrants.  However, do we want to allow people here that are fully vetted and will proudly call themselves American, OR do we want to go the way of Europe by sticking our heads in the sand out of PC concerns and allow immigrants to come here that want us to bend to their customs, honor their religion (at our expense), and quite possibly want to do us harm?!?  Ask your \"moderate\" Muslim if they will condemn Hamas?  Ask if they'll condemn San Bernadino?  Ask if they'll condemn female circumcision (or FemaleGenitalMutilation).  The answers may surprise you.\nNO Sharia in America!\nGoogle \"Rapes in Europe\"",
