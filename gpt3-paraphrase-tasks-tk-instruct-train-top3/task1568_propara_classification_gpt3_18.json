        "In this task, you are given a paragraph, an event and an entity. The event is part of the paragraph and it changes the state of the entity. Your task is to classify the state of the entity into one of three classes: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location and 3) known location. \"not exist\" means the entity doesn't exist anymore. \"unknown location\" means the entity exists but location is unknown. \"known location\" means the entity exists and location is known."
