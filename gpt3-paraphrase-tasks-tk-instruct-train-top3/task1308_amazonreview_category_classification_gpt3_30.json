I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

Would fights between students take the form of teens using technology on each other? Would the students self-identify as members of Electricity clans or Chemistry clans? Seems threadbare, but you cold still write a book worth reading if you gave it a real plot and interesting characters. This book is the fantasy equivalent.
