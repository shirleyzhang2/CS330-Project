            "input": "Passage: Property tax -- Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.\nQuestion: is house tax and property tax are same",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "The question asks whether the house tax is the same as property tax. As per the passage, property tax is also called house tax and so the label 1 (True) is correct."

Barq's, created by Edward Barq and bottled since the turn of the 20th century, is owned by the Barq family but bottled by the Coca-Cola Company. It was known as Barq's Famous Olde Tyme Root Beer until 2012.\nQuestion: is barq's root beer a pepsi product",

Limb loss is a result of either removal by amputation or congenital limb deficiency. However, phantom limb sensations can also occur following nerve avulsion or spinal cord injury.\nQuestion: is pain experienced in a missing body part or paralyzed area",

The series was created and executive produced by Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler, and Daniel Zelman, who previously created the FX series Damages. According to its official synopsis released by Netflix, Bloodline ``centers on a close-knit family of four adult siblings whose secrets and scars are revealed when their black sheep brother returns home.''\nQuestion: is the show bloodline based on a true story",

Tromp and Farneb\u00e4ck derived a recursive formula for legal positions L ( m , n ) (\\displaystyle L(m,n)) of a rectangle board with length m and n. The exact number of L ( 19 , 19 ) (\\displaystyle L(19,19)) is obtained in 2016. They also find an asymptotic formula L \u2248 A B m + n C m n (\\displaystyle L\\approx AB^(m+n)C^(mn)) , where A \u2248 0.8506399258457145 (\\displaystyle A\\approx 0.8506399258457145) , B \u2248 0.96553505933837387 (\\displaystyle B\\approx 0.96553505933837387) and C \u2248 2.975734192043357249381 (\\displaystyle C\\approx 2.975734192043357249381) . It has been estimated that the observable universe contains around 10 atoms, far fewer than the number of possible legal positions of regular board size (m=n=19). As the board gets larger, the percentage of the positions that are legal decreases.\nQuestion: are there more moves in go than atoms in the universe",
