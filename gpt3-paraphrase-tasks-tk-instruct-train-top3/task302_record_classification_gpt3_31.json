Tian Tian, the UK's only female giant panda, has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August.

Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as AugustShe has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years \n Questions:Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.

That's because they've heard and seen this before. \"I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over,\" then-Sen. Barack Obama said in November 2007. His administration put a two-year ban on lobbying post-service. In 2016, Trump channeled the same anger against Washington and is proposing to build on the same policies Obama instituted. \"Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them. I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you,\" Trump said in Akron, Ohio, in August. \"Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign. Because I don't want the lobbyists. I've had plenty of lobbyists. They do a good job. They give you whatever you want. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.\"Trump has proposed a five-year ban on lobbying after leaving his administrationWashington has plenty of ways to get around being called a \"lobbyist\" \n Questions:The _ aides added Thursday that the new policy would apply to officials looking to work for overseas governments, too, for their entire lives.

Robert Mueller's appointment Wednesday as special counsel to probe Russian election meddling and any collusion by Trump campaign aides elevates the investigation clear of partisanship and the threat of White House interference. It therefore may offer the best chance for a politically bulletproof accounting of the guilt or innocence of members of the President's inner circle. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision to opt for a special counsel is also an antidote to fears that the US political system still has the capacity to investigate itself and its most powerful players.Trump fired Comey last weekA special counsel was appointed Wednesday \n Questions:Wednesday's announcement might also be remembered as the moment that the norms that apply to other politicians finally also ensnared _.
