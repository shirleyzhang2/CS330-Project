            "input": "What a let down. Bought the groupon after reading reviews and looking at the website. The bar itself was clean and looked nicer than what belongs in the neighborhood. We were greeted by the bartender whom we ended up feeling very sorry for by the end of our experience. Not only was she the only bartender but was the cook as well. We were soon informed that the website wasn't correct because the owner hasn't updated it. Also, many of the items on the menu weren't available because the owner hasn't been around as he just had a baby. We ordered a pizza and wings to go and a couple of bloody Mary's while we waited. The drinks were good but the bartender was working hard because of other patrons and our food order. I overheard the bartender let other patrons know that she was out of their preferred alcohol. Now the food: the \\\"\"pizza\\\"\" was a small flat bread that got cold really fast and was served in a box usually reserved for an extra large pizza. The food is mediocre at best and there are much cooler bars to hang at downtown. Sorry, I just can't recommend to anyone. The bartender was nice though, she just didn't have the tools to do her job.",

            "input": "My husband and I tried the buffet last Sunday evening.  We won't go back. Customers get confused what line to stand in because the buffet and cafe are located right next to each other.  The hostess was rather rude...yelled across the room for the party ahead of us instead of greeting nicely and showing the party to their table.  The seating areas were very dirty...carpet needed cleaning last year, food dropped on floor and not picked up by staff, carpet had large rip that I tripped over.  Peel and eat shrimp were not cleaned well.  Bread rolls still in plastic bags instead of served in baskets.  For an International Buffet, I thought the food selection was not good.  Sneeze guards were placed really low so the food was hard to get to and they were dirty with smeared food.  One of the worst buffets we have been to in a long time.",

She always comes home with cute little bows on her ears and she smells so lovely.  He charges so little compared to other grooming services in Las Vegas, but the quality of the service is right on par with the rest.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",
