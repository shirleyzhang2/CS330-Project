        "In this task you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. Your task is to classify the type of irony the tweet has, and label it accordingly. There are three types of irony that you need to be aware of: polarity, situational, and other. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Other types of irony are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
