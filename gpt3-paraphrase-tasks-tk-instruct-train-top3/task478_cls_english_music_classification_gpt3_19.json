I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Authors note: For some reason I rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars, although I thought I had rated a bit higher, and since I can't change that \"star-rating\" now, I will say this:    This album is good, borderline great at times, and shows at a lot of promise. It's hyper and rough around the edges, but a lot of fun. It contains a handful good songs, and few great ones, here are a few of the standouts:    \"Bicycle, Bicycle, You Are My Bicycle\", and \"Adventure\", are both good...Although I feel that \"We Will Vacation, You Can Be My Parasol\" is a better song, and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio, it could have \"the single\", but it's a great song either way.    The next portion I would like to direct to members BYOP:    Whatever muse you guys followed to come up with \"October, First Account\", keep following it, and if need be, hold it hostage at gunpoint. That song is \"the single\" of the entire album, and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album, the skies the limit.",

Records' &quot;A Heavy Dose of Lite Psych&quot; compilation in Mojo magazine. The reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself, everything else was bonus. I was intrigued by the description of &quot;what Radiohead may have sounded like in the Summer of Love&quot;. Receiving the compilation CD, I immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it. When I heard the album had been re-released, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I have to admit I set myself up for disappointment. The only other tracks that come close to comparing are &quot;Land of Sensations and Delights&quot; (little more than two minutes), &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. None of these tracks can match &quot;Fly&quot;, however, and many of the others sound like Jay forgot to write the rest of the song (like the last track on side 1, &quot;Nobody&quot;, if I remember correctly). It's still interesting, but I would not rate it as five stars. I'm hoping I'm not misled with Aerovons and Gandalf (both of which I'm getting ready to buy, and comparisons to the Beatles and the Zombies are enjolling me to buy these)",

            "input": "Much better that anything Tool ever did . Yeah, man. I used to be like really stupid. I got bad grades in school. But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, \"whoa!\" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market \"Lonesome Crowded West\" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club?     This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I \"get\" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, \"My thoughts weren't so loud\" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to \"This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About\" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like \"The Moon and Antarctica\" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who \"gets Modest Mouse\" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like \"Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart,\" you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing.     j5w2k9@hotmail.com",
