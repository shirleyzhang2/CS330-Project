        "Given a sentence and a profession, your task is to determine whether the given profession's gender is identifiable or unidentifiable. To do this, you will need to identify any coreference links with gendered pronouns. If the profession mentioned in the sentence can be identified as either male or female, then it is considered identifiable. If the profession cannot be identified as either male or female, then it is considered unidentifiable."
