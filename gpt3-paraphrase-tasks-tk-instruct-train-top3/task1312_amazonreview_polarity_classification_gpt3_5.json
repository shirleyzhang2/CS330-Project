            "input": "These are junk! Both bulbs have burned out within a two month period!! I cannot believe that this company can be in business with such poor quality. I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product. Because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, it's a negative review."

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought more. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, it's a positive review."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

Even with my entire body balanced on top of the peg, I couldn't get the rubber compressed down enough to get the pin through, and even if I had, the pin meant to hold it in place (one of which is missing) is litterally just a pin the sits in a hole without any tension or resistance to keep it in place. It would have fallen out on the first ride. Also, the stitching on the seat is red, not white. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME.",
