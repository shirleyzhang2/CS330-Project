            "input": "In one work this author details the life of a tomb-maker who makes extra money by playing the organ at an insane asylum, while another of his novels sees Swartz give a refugee proper documentation only after he tells him his life story in the title Portuguese city. In addition to The Black Obelisk and The Night in Lisbon, he also wrote about Robert and Otto selling their auto workshop and visiting Patrice in a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium in his novel The Three Comrades, while the turbulent life of the German surgeon Ravic is told in The Arch of Triumph. Another of his novels, The Road Back, is thought to be a sequel to his most famous book, in which the patriotic teacher Kantorek convinces Paul Bumer and his friends to join the Germany Army during World War I. For 10 points, name this German author who wrote All Quiet on the Western Front.",

            "input": "In one election, this man attacked Helen Gahagan Douglas by calling her \"\"the pink lady. \"\" At the American National Exhibition in Moscow, this man engaged in the \"\"Kitchen Debate\"\" with Nikita Khrushchev. After losing a governor's race to Pat Brown, this politician erroneously said the press wouldn't have him to kick around anymore. In another election, this man defended his use of a slush fund with the \"\"Checkers\"\" speech. For 10 points, name this former Vice President under Eisenhower, who lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, but eventually was elected president in 1968.",

            "explanation": "The text is describing some events that took place in the past, and there's nothing relevant to literature, science or art involved, so the category is history."

            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke. Following World War II, this artist produced such collections as Mormon Villages and The Irish Countryman, and her report with her husband Paul Taylor led to her employment by Roy Stryker, who had hired Esther Bubley for similar reasons. Her work was used in an exhibit on Executive Order 9066, but she remains better known for a work whose title figure remained unknown for forty years until she identified herself as Florence Owens Thompson, a portrait produced as the result of her hiring by the Farm Security Administration. For ten points, identify this photographer who produced some of the most famous images of the Great Depression, including Migrant Mother.",
            "output": "Literature",
            "explanation": "Although an artist might contribute to literature, going further through text shows that the mentioned artist is a painter, so the correct label is fine arts."

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",
            "output": "History",
            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."

Thus, the main character does not warn the Polish family he has observed of the danger. For 10 points, Tadzio causes the title event upon Gustav von Aschenbach in what Thomas Mann novella",

            "input": "Performing a Wick rotatition of the time coordinate reduces the Feynman kernel to a functional which is similar to this quantity. The symmetry number is an overcounting correction factor that appears along with some power of the rotation temperature in the denominator for ones representing rotational energies. Its value for a system composed of several subsystems equals the product of its values for the subsystems, which implies that the Helmholtz free energy is additive over subsystems since the Helmholtz free energy is proportional to its logarithm. This quantity can also be thought of as a normalization constant since it is simply the integral over all states of the degeneracy factor times e to the negative beta times the energy of that microstate. For 10 points, name this quantity whose \"canonical\" form simply equals the sum over states of Boltzmann factors, and describes the macroscopic properties of a thermodynamic system.",

His policies were opposed by such groups as Order and Freedom and Fatherland and Liberty, but enabled by the laissez-faire ethos of the \"Schneider Doctrine,\" which allowed his victory over Paper Manufacturer Jorge Alessandri to stand. Disturbances during this man's time in office include the El Teniente Copper strike and the rebellion of a tank regiment near the capital. His eventual successor replaced the loyal Carlos Prats as a member of this man's cabinet in August of 1973, one month before he would lead a coup against this man. For 10 points, identify this leader of the Popular Unity Party, a Socialist president of Chile who was deposed by Augusto Pinochet.",
