            "input": "I fail to see how this restaurant is celebrating colonial rule. Yes, the name of the restaurant and some of the items on the menu reference colonial rule. However, where does it say they are celebrating it? For example, a Holocaust museum does not celebrate the Holocaust because it contains the name in its title. Nor does it celebrate the Holocaust because it is full of pictures of gas chambers and emaciated bodies. The museum does, however, act as a point of remembrance and history. No doubt, children visit the museum and find out about the Holocaust for the first time. How many kids know about colonialism? Maybe they can learn by going to places like this restaurant/cafe.\n\nI fail to see how the owner is celebrating or embracing colonialism. It happened and we should NEVER forget, the events shouldn\u2019t be forgotten about and swept under the carpet.\n\nFinally, if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t go. There are much more important things to worry about. Donald Trump, for one.",
