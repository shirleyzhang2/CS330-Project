        "Given a dialogue between an automated system and a user looking for suggestions for pubs, restaurants and coffee shops in Cambridge, output the price range the user is looking for. The price range can take one of four values: Cheap, Moderate, Expensive and Don't Care. If the user asks for the prices of items provided at a pub, restaurant or coffee shop but doesn't mention the price range they are looking for, the correct classification will be Don't Care. If the user does not mention a particular price, the correct classification will be Don't Care."
