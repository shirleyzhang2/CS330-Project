        "You will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your task is to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts taken from the context into a summary. Abstractive questions require you to paraphrase the context using new sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, typically yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

            "input": "We identified some limitations during the process, which we describe in this section.\n\nWhen deciding publisher partisanship, the number of people from whom we computed the score was small. For example, de Stentor is estimated to reach 275K readers each day on its official website. Deciding the audience leaning from 55 samples was subject to sampling bias. Besides, the scores differ very little between publishers. None of the publishers had an absolute score higher than 1, meaning that even the most partisan publisher was only slightly partisan. Deciding which publishers we consider as partisan and which not is thus not very reliable.\n\nThe article-level annotation task was not as well-defined as on a crowdsourcing platform. We included the questions as part of an existing survey and didn't want to create much burden to the annotators. Therefore, we did not provide long descriptive text that explained how a person should annotate an article. We thus run under the risk of annotator bias. This is one of the reasons for a low inter-rater agreement. \n Question: What limitations are mentioned?",
