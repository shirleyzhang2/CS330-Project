Nokia is attempting to woo app developers with such incentives as pre-installing their software on the forthcoming phone, prominent promotion for their products and funding development of an app, according to three people involved in the negotiations. A vibrant app store has become a major selling point to smartphone customers. In the past, Nokia, which sells the highest volume of mobile phones worldwide, has made efforts to work with some creators of apps for its platforms. A Nokia spokeswoman said the company offers app developers a variety of incentives, some in partnership with Microsoft, which include coding assistance and marketing. \"We do not disclose these arrangements, as each is different,\" she said. Microsoft declined to comment for this story.Nokia is offering to pay developers to make apps for its new phone, sources saySuch payments from phone manufacturers are unusualMicrosoft did something similar last year, but its Windows Phone app catalog is still lackingNokia is set to launch its first Windows phone by the end of the year, sources say \n Questions:On Tuesday, Microsoft began distributing the new version of Windows Phone, which will run on the _ device.

Although \"SNL\" was unfair in one way -- it lumped Trump and O'Reilly's history of sexism together -- when in reality Trump's is far worse. The show opened the show with Alec Baldwin as Trump at a town hall meeting in Kentucky. The sketch comically summed up why Trump supporters still like him even though some of Trump's proposed policies would personally hurt them: \"It's like you found a finger in your chili, but you still eat the chili, because you told everyone how much you love chili.\"\"SNL\" returned this week, with Alec Baldwin playing both Donald Trump and Bill O'ReillyDean Obeidallah: It succeeded in producing provocative political comedy sketches \n Questions:\"_\" deserves to win several awards for its recent performances.
