        "You will be given a target race and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a generalization about a group of people that is often oversimplified. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the generalization about a group of people that is often oversimplified. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
