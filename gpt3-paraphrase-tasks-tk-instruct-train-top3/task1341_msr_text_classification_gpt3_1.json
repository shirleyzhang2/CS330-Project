    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence, you will need to judge the quality of the sentence by answering \"Good\" or \"Bad\". A sentence is considered to be good if it is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors. If a sentence is bad, this means that it is either difficult to understand or has grammatical errors."
