        "In this task, you will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the other-need strategy, otherwise output No. The other-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves. For instance, describing the need for firewood to keep the kids warm."

'Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you. Then I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food. This is the lowest I can offer'",

I'm with a couple other Floridians so we're not really too worried about firewood as we prefer it cooler, anyway.. and we know the lake is nearby that's stocked with trout for eating if necessary (and of course some fresh water's there, too) - so.. I can tell you that I could go totally without Firewood if I needed to.. I'd rather not, but I could.'
