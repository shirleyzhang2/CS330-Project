While our auto insurance picked up the initial $5K, it's been significantly out of pocket for us since.\n\nMy kids are now recovered (credit their young bodies), but since the accident my wife suffers from constant jaw-pain, neck-pain, headache, and facial numbness (she can't feel half her face).\n\nDue to the nature of her injuries, much of her treatment, such as physical therapy, is going uncovered by our insurance. For example, United deemed her jaw pain to be TMD, and swiftly cut off payments to the jaw specialist. To be fair, other things, like neurologist appts (and the imaging they've ordered) *have* been covered.\n\n(Continued)",
