            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

The Saudi oil glut will pass but taxing the state oil workers out of business and keeping oil and gas investment out will ruin Alaska under SB 130 (tax oil workers to death), HB 247 ( tax oil investors out of Alaska for decades)!!\n\nThe solution is clear: don't panic and use the $ 10 Billion in the Constitutional Reserve to pay the prepared Capital Budget and do no harm, next year oil prices may increase and all will be well.\n\nIf not Alaska will still have over $ 6 Billion in Constitutional Budget Reserve to pay the next year's Capital Budget! \n\nWith $ 3 Billion left over for the following year! \n\nIt is wrong to pass HB 250, it takes Alaskans money & HB 245 takes the Permanent fund so Government can better pay themselves at the people's expense!\n\nUse the savings!",
