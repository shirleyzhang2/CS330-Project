I got the red devil sandwich which was super yummy but spicy. On a scale of 1-10 it was a hot damn! Glad I had the cole slaw to cool it down. Really fun sitting in the room with the huge shark tank. Going back for sure!",

I got the swordfish steak, the lobster tacos, and the pineapple cake flaming thing for dessert.  Everything was spectacular.  I wish I could afford such amazing food all of the time, but one day... Until then, I'll have to wait until Giants Spring Training for my parents to get to Scottsdale to take me out here again.",
