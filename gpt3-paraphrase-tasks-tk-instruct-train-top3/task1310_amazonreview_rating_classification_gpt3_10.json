I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

Once I added 8 oz instead and it tasted like someone had drank chocolate milk and then taken a sip out of my water bottle, if that gives you an idea of what it tasted like. It only comes with 14 servings, too. Since the flavor isn't that important to me anyways, and the nutrition is good, I still recommend this brand, but definitely buy in bulk.",
