I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

For some reason on the new brushless version, they got rid of the battery holder, and came up with this terrible rubber band idea. The frame arrived all warped to begin with. I heated it up with a heat gun and set a book on top to make it flat again. It worked, but as soon as you put a rubber band on, it will warp the frame again. Also, the little hooks that hold the rubber bands are worthless and pop off mid flight anyway. I ended up putting the rubber bands completely over the top of the canopy instead. It is better, but still not good. The only reason this got two stars instead of one is because the 3 blade props seem to perform better than the 4 blade props that came on my BetaFPV 65 pro.",
