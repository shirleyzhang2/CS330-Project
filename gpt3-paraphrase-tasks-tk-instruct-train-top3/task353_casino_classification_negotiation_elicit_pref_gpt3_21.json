We're planning on doing a lot of fishing since my son's been in love with fishing toys and is currently in love with eating fish (he hasn't gotten tired of eating it every night for dinner).

If you'll be fishing and eating your catch, you'll probably need more firewood than food. And with the filters, you will need some extra water, especially for your little guy.
