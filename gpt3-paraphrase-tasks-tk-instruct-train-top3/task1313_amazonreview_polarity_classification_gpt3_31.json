I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Polarity: negative",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Polarity: positive",

Fortunately I was able to use those for drawers and keep the three inch handles for the cupboards. Had that not worked out, I was close to having to return them. The second box was ok.....thirty handles with three inch spacing as advertised. So check the contents carefully when you get them.....I think I saw other reviews where people didn't get all three inch handles. I still rated it five stars due to the quality. \n Polarity: positive",
