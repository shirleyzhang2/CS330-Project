        "In this task, you are given a short story consisting of 5 sentences. The second sentence is missing, and you are given a candidate sentence to fill in the blank. You need to identify if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it does, indicate your answer with \"Yes\". If it does not, indicate your answer with \"No\". The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences form a consistent story."
