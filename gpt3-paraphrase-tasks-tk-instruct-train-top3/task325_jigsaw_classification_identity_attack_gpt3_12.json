The replacements promised had to do with removing restriction which would bring he price of care down. Our country doesn't provide auto insurance, or life insurance, or homeowners insurance. But, why health?\n\nIt's a way to control the masses. ObamaCare, and subsequently, RINOCare, TrumpCrae or Swampcare do basically the same things.\n\nI also wrote in opposition to Trump that he was a big proponent of \"single payer\".\n\nAllow for cross state line health insurance, MSA's or HSA's with higher payroll deductibility, catastrophic care insurance, the ability to hold on to insurance if one loses his or her job. That last one would have alleviated a lot of \"preexisting condition\" coverage.\n\nThe market every time will produce a better product or service. Every time the payer or further removed for the consumer, prices rise because they become hidden.\n\nThe GOP establishment is a bunch of liars.",
