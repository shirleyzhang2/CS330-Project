Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as AugustShe has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years \n Questions:Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.

When Chambers arrived at Arsenal in July 2014, he was pitched straight into the action and made an impressive debut in the Community Shield victory over Manchester City. He never looked back and was named the club's first player of the month. By this point of last season, Chambers had made 20 appearances \u2013 which totalled 1346 minutes \u2013 and been capped three times by England. This season, however, has presented some challenges. Arsene Wenger is turning him from a right-back into a central defender but he wants that transition to take place at the Emirates Stadium. The Arsenal manager would not let Chambers seek a loan in the window but he is not giving him much game time, either. So far Chambers has only been involved in 324 minutes of the campaign.Calum Chambers has struggled for minutes this season at ArsenalArsene Wenger is converting Chambers from a right back to a centre backChambers is not becoming disillusioned at club despite lack of actionHe will start at the heart of England U21's defence against Switzerland \n Questions:One thing of which Chambers is assured is regular games with _'s Under 21s.
