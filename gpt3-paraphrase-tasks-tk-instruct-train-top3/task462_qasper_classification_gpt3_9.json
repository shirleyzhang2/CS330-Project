        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. A Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. The choices are typically either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

            "input": "Another approach for generating query and image representations is treating images as a black box. Given the statistics of our dataset (3B query, image pairs with 220M unique queries and 900M unique images), we know that different queries co-occur with the same images. Intuitively, if a query $q_1$ co-occurs with many of the same images as query $q_2$ , then $q_1$ and $q_2$ are likely to be semantically similar, regardless of the visual content of the shared images. Thus, we can use a method that uses only co-occurrence statistics to better understand how well we can capture relationships between queries. \n Question: Could you learn such embedding simply from the image annotations and without using visual information?",
