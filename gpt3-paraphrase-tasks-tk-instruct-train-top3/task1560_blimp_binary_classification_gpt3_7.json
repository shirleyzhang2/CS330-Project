        "You will be shown an English sentence. Your task is to output 'good' if the sentence is a correct representation of an anaphor number agreement, or 'bad' if it is an incorrect representation. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement is a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match in plurality."
