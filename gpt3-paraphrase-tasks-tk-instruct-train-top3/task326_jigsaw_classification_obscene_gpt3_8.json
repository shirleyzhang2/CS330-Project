        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to output 'obscene' or 'non-obscene' if the comment is considered obscene or not, respectively. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

So, why would you consider it unfair for CBC, in revamping the post-Mansbridge The National, to choose NOT to  include  YET ANOTHER European-extract male to host the show? Wasn't decades of Mansbridge enough to justify finding another ethnic/gender mix than Mansbridge's to replace him?  Anyway, the new 4 person hosting includes the ethnicity you so value (European, 50%), and the gender you so value (male, 50%), just not together simultaneously in one individual host. So? Nitpicker, or what?",
