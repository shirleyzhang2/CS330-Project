    "Definition": [
        "Given a news headline in English, you are expected to output 'sarcastic' or 'non-sarcastic' depending on whether the headline is sarcastic or not. A sarcastic sentence is one that uses words that mean the opposite of what is really meant, either to insult someone, show irritation, or for amusement."
