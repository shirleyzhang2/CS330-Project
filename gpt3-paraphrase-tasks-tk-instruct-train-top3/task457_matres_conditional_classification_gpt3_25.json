        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You have to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action or not. We say a verb is hypothetical if it involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. A verb is conditional if it appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb is conditional or hypothetical and \"No\" otherwise."
