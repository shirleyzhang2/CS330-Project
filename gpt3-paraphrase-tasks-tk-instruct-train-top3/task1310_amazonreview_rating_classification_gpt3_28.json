I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

Upstairs we get several channels with good picture quality; however, in the living room where we watch TV the most we only get two channels. We have repositioned the antenna several times with no change which is very frustrating. I sent an email to the company about my problem and after a week I still haven't had a response which isn't good customer service. ALSO, when we were running the supplied cable through the ceiling it pulled apart so we ended up using the existing cable we were using for my old bulky antenna which pulled in all the local channels. It's very disappointing that the new antenna doesn't pull in all the local channels where we sit to watch TV.",
