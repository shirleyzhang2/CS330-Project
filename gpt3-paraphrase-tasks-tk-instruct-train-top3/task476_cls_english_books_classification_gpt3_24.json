            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "An HR Managment Tool to share with those \"special employees\" . There are employees who we know are smart and they conflict in any number of ways with management or with others within the organization.  This book helps HR managers help their business owners and corporation shapers get into the thick skulls of those  special employees that are shining stars on the verge of becoming supernovas.  Corporations many times are charged with terminating an employee or facing the challenge of having an employee that is extremely talented terminate their employment, only to find out that this is basically unnecessary if they can successfully negotiate the behaviors of the employees so that it better serves the businesses' need, not just the narcassist needs of the employee.  Yes, they work hard, but the company is in fact compensating them for that with the cars, cash and other perks they so successfully earn, and if they didn't perform, wouldn't earn those things.  It's time that business managers and their HR people  take back their responsibility and partnership of helping build successful employee careers by sharing with them the challenges and insights they face in building their companies successfully.  Fortune 500 executives face these challenges, just as smaller companies do.  Get Out Of Your Own Way At Work helps these supernovas realize before they self-destruct their careers, someone elses or far worse, the business' success, where they may be playing the part within this challenge, not just passing the buck and blame over to others, or taking advantage in ways that end up blowing up in their faces, making a mess of their futures or the company's.    I triped over this book as an HR manager searching for tools to help my business owner/manager successfully navigate a similar problem.     It should be required reading for all entry level employees (along with another favorite of mine \"The Rules of  Work and The Rules of Management\" .   Because employees step out of the academic world usually and then enter the business world, there are no hard fast rules, even if you attended an executive business university to guide you in how to manage yourself in the environment, or were raised with the self-disclipine required to be successful in the business world.  These tools  of knowledge are like boot-camp for entering the business world.  HR folks suffer in silence trying to help these people and because its really up to them to get the business procedures and policies of the company when told to them,  this book helps communicate to them what they don't get or what businesses usually don't think they need to communicate during the hiring process because any other behavior is cause for disciplinary action.    The behaviors described in this book suit all types of industries and organizations.  Dr. Goulston explains it so brilliantly and seamlessly, it's clear what our choices should be if we still exhibit the same behaviors after one is assigned to reading it because there is a chapter within the book about how the guilt of these descision effects us about the tough-love we should make if they don't get it.   For those rare few that your organization seeks to help and no end to the frustruation or how to communicate it to those that create it,  this book is a treasure for growth and  career development within the business environment, no matter what the employee's behavior is.  I believe that if applied the insights within this book can help prevent these behaviors from developing or derail if read early in one's own career.  Even if HR people read it and share the knowledge with their owner/managers, it will tune us and our business owners and corporations shapers into how to recognize it early enough in an employee to help manage to getting rid of it.    If you have anyone in your organzation that sounds like what I've described here, do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK and make it required reading within your organzation",
