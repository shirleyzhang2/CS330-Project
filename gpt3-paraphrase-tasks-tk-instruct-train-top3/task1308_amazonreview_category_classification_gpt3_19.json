I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

I thought I was getting a year-long planner but this only works for 6 months, and you have to go through the work of writing in all the dates yourself! It makes no sense that the weekly pages are in a completely different section than the daily pages because who has the time to flip back and forth through all those pages? The idea of daily and weekly goal setting and intentions is what drew me to this product, but it is completely disorganized! The pages are also low quality and unattractive. The product description promised so much but didn't actually detail the number of pages or what the planner could be used for. I think this could work if you are just trying to focus on a few goals for a short period of time. It does not work as a daily planner. Returning it and going back to my tried and true Day Designer! \n Category: home_improvement",
