I wonder if public enforcement employees will ever accept responsibility for the sh**** things they do.  I guess full accountability is only required of inmates, who are always responsible not only for their own actions, but those of DOC and law enforcement. You see, inmates either \"manipulate\" poor, stupid COs and other DOC employees into doing something heinous--like killing someone in custody--breaking DOC regulations (they should know) or cause a problem simply by existing. Same with law enforcement.  Someone always \"makes\" them behave violently and/or break the law. Oops, I meant \"fear for their safety.\"",
