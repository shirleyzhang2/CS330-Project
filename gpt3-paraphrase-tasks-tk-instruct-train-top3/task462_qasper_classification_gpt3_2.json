        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. You have to classify the questions into one of three categories: \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". Extractive questions can be answered by taking extracts from the context and concatenating them into a summary. Abstractive questions require paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, typically either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

            "input": "We would expect that explanation performance should correlate with prediction performance. Since Possible-answer knowledge is primarily needed to decide if the net has enough information to answer the challenge question without guessing and relevant-variable knowledge is needed for the net to know what to query, we analyzed the network's performance on querying and answering separately. The memory network has particular difficulty learning to query relevant variables, reaching only about .5 accuracy when querying. At the same time, it learns to answer very well, reaching over .9 accuracy there. Since these two parts of the interaction are what we ask it to explain in the two modes, we find that the quality of the explanations strongly correlates with the quality of the algorithm executed by the network. \n Question: How do they measure correlation between the prediction and explanation quality?",

In this instance the physical attributes that the term \u201cfast\u201d pertains to could be the horsepower, or it could be the car's form factor (how the car looks). However, we do not know exactly which attributes the term \u201cfast\u201d refers to. We train a series of classifiers in order to classify car-speak. We train three classifiers on the review vectors that we prepared in Section SECREF8. The classifiers we use are K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) BIBREF13. \n Question: Is car-speak language collection of abstract features that classifier is later trained on?",
