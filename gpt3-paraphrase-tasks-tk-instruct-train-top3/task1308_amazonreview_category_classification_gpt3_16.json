            "input": "Review: Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

I go to the gym 4-5 times a week, start with a mile on the elliptical and then an hour of weights using these headphones and they've worked great. When the battery is running low I might get a quick static feedback like the range is too far from my shorts pocket to the headphones on my ear but it's extremely brief. Sound quality and noise isolation is great, with the volume up I can't hear the generic workout radio they have on or much of the weights clinking together. Overall great headphones and would recommend. \n Category: electronics",
