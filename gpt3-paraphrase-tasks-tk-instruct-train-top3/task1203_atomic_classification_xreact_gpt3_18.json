        "You are given two phrases, Head and Tail, which are events possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words.

The feeling is an emotional reaction on the part of X or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, X might feel good about [one]self. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
