I'll admit the only reason i come to here is because of the service and that rosemary potato chicken pizza (I rarely support corporate, I'm too hipster lol) . My partner had the pasta which i was questionable on however it was great and spicy. Our server was so sweet and very helpful. She walked by with this cheese crisp guacamole plate for another table with I hated her for due to I wanted to order it too. Food does take some time but this place is a small establishment. I'll be back.",

            "input": "Very impressive so far. The style is very similar to the much-larger Cosmopolitan, but there is an emphasis on customer service that is noticeable. Little touches like a bellman to walk you to your room and point out amenities, complimentary full breakfast (with omelet station) every morning, and staff that great you at every opportunity. Some of these might be just for the opening this weekend, but there is almost nothing that resembles the previous property (i.e. Bill's Gambling Hall and Saloon).\\n\\nPROS\\n- Modern decor and furniture\\n- Complimentary full breakfast with omelet station\\n- Drai's on the rooftop adds a nightclub and dayclub to entertainment options\\n\\nCONS\\n- Difficult to access via car - the driveway is on Flamingo (which has horrendous traffic) and is easy to miss\\n- Not everything is open just yet - Giada's is scheduled to open 03-JUN\\n\\nTIP\\nIf driving, try to avoid Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip) and approach from Koval (to the east of the Strip).",
