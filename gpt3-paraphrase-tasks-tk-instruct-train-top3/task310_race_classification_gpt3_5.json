            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns.

The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them.

Today's do-it-all mobiles have a lot in common with the computer. The only difference may be that they fit in your pocket and you pay by the minutes to use them. Some of the things a cellphone can do for you will be available this year:          Surf at speed          Cellpones that let you use the Web have been around for years. So, what's new? Well, faster third-generation(3G) net works let you surf at anywhere. This then allows a carrier to send video, music, and games to your phone. Possible choices are from LG Electronic VX 8000 and Motorola V 1150.          Listen as you go          The problem with most cellphone MP3 players is that they hold only a handful of songs. But, that's about to change. Sony Ericsson's new W800i can hold around 150 songs in its 500 MB memory. And Sumsung's SPH-V5400 even comes with a 1.5 GB hard drive. Mobile phones may eventually replace mini-MP3 players, especially for teens.          Say cheese          Camera cellphones are not new either. But, most of them have limitations: around 1-megapixel . But new technology has made 2-megapixel units more common and 3-megapixel units are showing up soon. Some 2-megapixel models, like Sony Ericsson's K750i, offer limited zoom and focus controls. Others, like LG's recent MMA7110, can even capture 30 minutes of full- motion video.          Portable TV          You say you like \"watching TV\"? That's what Sumsung MM-A700 wants to give you. The new model lets users watch popular TV programs--for a fee. Other choices are Nokia's 6620, Sanyo's MM 7400 and NEC's N940.The NEC model lets you watch public TV--no fee.          The above are just a handful of what you will see in the coming months. Further down the road, your mobile phone may play a host of other roles, such as mobile credit card, position locator...

            "input": "Article: Farm-raised pigs are dirty, smelly animals that get no respect. They're also an environmental hazard. Their manure contains phosphorus ,which, when it rains, runs off into lakes and rivers, consuming oxygen, killing fish, stimulating algae overgrowth and emitting greenhouse gases.     Doing away with the pig is not an option. Pigs provide more dietary protein, more cheaply, to more people than any other animal. Northern Europe still maintains the highest pig-to-human ratio in the world (2-1 in Denmark), but East Asia is catching up. During the 1990s, pork production doubled in Vietnam and grew by 70 percent in China--along densely populated coastlines, pig density exceeds 100 animals per square kilometer. The resulting pollution is \"threatening fragile coastal marine habitats including mangroves ,coral reefs and sea grasses ,\"according to a report released in February by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. As it turns out, there is a solution to the pig problem, but it requires a change of mind-set among environmentalists and the public. Two Canadian scientists have created a pig whose manure doesn't contain very much phosphorus at all. If this variety of pig were adopted widely, It could greatly reduce a major source of pollution. But the Enviropig, as they call it, is the product of genetic modification--which is anathema  to many Westerners.     The Enviropig is one of many new technologies that are putting environmentalists and organic-food supporters in _ : should they remain categorically  opposed to genetically modified (GM)foods even at the expense of the environment? Elsewhere, trees grown for paper could be made amenable to much more efficient processing, reducing both energy usage and toxic chemical bleach  in waste water from paper mills. The most significant GM applications will be ones that help lessen the problem of agriculture , which accounts for 38percent of the world's landmass and is crowding out natural ecosystems and species habitats. Chances are, farmers will continue to grow their polluting organic pork, their allergenic organic soy and their neurotoxin  sprayed organic apples. Worse still, they will make sure that no one else gets a choice in the matter of improving the conditions of life on earth--unless, that is, others rise up and demand an alternative. \n Question: Which of the following statements is TRUE? \n Options: (A) Pigs bring more destruction than benefit to human beings. (B) No other countries have the higher percentage of pig-to-human than East Asia. (C) The pork production has increased to 70% in China. (D) The pollution brought by pigs is a killer to the creature of the sea. \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: Focus on class     SOME US parents are sad that their high school children score badly in math , science and reading compared to kids in other countries.    There has been an endless series of mostly fruitless education reforms to address this gap ( ).    Now comes an approach based on the insights  of a group of US exchange students. They spent a year in some of the most successful high schools in the world -in Finland, Poland and South Korea.    Author and journalist Amanda Ripley followed three exchange students for her new book, The Smartest Kids in the World - and How They Got That Way. She argues that to improve academics, US schools should de-emphasize sports.    Instead, students should bring their passion and intensity  to academics , she concludes.    \"High school in Finland, Korea and Poland had a purpose, just like high school football practice in America,\" she writes. \"There was a big , important contest at the end, and the score counted.\"   Sports are a distraction  ,Ripley argues, and most countries require them to take place outside of school.    Trading in US school sports culture would be a huge change for people in the US , who respect teamwork and sportsmanship as training for life.    But playing down sports could pay off, as it has elsewhere, if we redirect money , focus and glory to learning.    Ripley is critical  of memorization in South Korean education, but she praises the system's high goals and the free-dom its students have to fail and recover through hard work.    Too often , we don't ask teachers to give our kids harder assignments  -and we're quick to complain about a failing grade. What's working elsewhere is to set ambitious  goals for kids ,and then allow them to discover that they have it within themselves to reclaim  success from failure.   Each of the countries in Smartest Kids came to education reform after an economic crisis  . Finland was losing jobs after graduating just 10 percent of its teens from high school in the 1950s. Today , the graduation rate is 95 percent . Poland's wakeup came in 1999, as students consistently tested below average in reading.    We've tried so many \"reforms\" in education. Maybe what we need is a truly radical  shift away from sports in favor of schooling. \n Question: Which of the following statements about education in South Korea is True according to the article? \n Options: (A) High academic scores are considered an important measure of education quality in South Korea. (B) The memorization skills of South Korean students are the keys to their academic success. (C) South Korean teachers emphasize teamwork and sportsmanship as much as American teachers do. (D) South Korea started education reforms in the 1950s to improve students' reading skills. \n Asnwer: A",
