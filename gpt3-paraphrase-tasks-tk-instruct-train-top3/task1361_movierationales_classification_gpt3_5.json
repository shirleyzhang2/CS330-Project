restoring properties .\nsound pretty heavy ?\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film 's constant barrage of humor .\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him\n( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , can not avoid looking at .\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good .\nsince they 've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean - luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard 's trademark , with his usual aplomb .\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android - wishing - to - be - human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .\ndespite many other critics ' negative opinions , f .\nmurray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough .\nru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .\nlike the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .\nru'afro is no khan from star trek ii -- the best trek villain ever -- but he is much better than the forgettable dr .\nsoran from star trek : generations .\n( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . )\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with .\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with .\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .\na particular plot point involving anij 's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection 's special effects were surprisingly disappointing .\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior does n't look quite right for a reason i can not explain .\ndespite star trek : insurrection 's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film .\nit maintains roddenberry 's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , do n't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .\ni 'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .\nrated pg , i ca n't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .",
