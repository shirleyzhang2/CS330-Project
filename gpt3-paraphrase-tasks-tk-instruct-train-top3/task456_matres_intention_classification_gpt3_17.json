        "Given a context and a verb separated by a newline character, you must identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, a wish, or none of the above. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). Output 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish. Output 'No' if the verb does not refer to any of those."
