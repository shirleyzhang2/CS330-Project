        "In this task, you will be given a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. If the sentence is overruling, output 'overruling'. If the sentence is non-overruling, output 'non-overruling'."
