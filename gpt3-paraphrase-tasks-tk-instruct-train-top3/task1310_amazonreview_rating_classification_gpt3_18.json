I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I believe as the author said that learnings you get from this book with completely transform your body and overall health for the better and new you.
