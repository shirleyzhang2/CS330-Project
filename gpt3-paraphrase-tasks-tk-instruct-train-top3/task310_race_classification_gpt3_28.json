            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now. But I hope more smiling faces will be drawn on it. \n Questions: When has the poem been written? \n Options: (A) At the beginning of the last semester. (B) At the end of the year.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them. (C) Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy. (D) Because many reporters have shown the problem of the systems. \n Answer: D",

            "input": "Article: In addition to writing articles and books, Mark Twain delighted the audience with his public lectures about the faraway places he visited on his travels. People were eager to learn about his trips to places like the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Egypt and the Holy Land. Twain often used the fees he earned from his lectures to pay for more adventures. His well-attended performances also served to bring attention to his published work. At that time, the public lecture was a very popular form of entertainment, and audiences' expectations ran high, but Twain never failed to amuse them. Twan also wrote on amusing subjects. In 1873, he released a book called The Gilded Age. The book was a satire of the very wealthy of the time. A satire is a work that makes fun of bad human behavior, such as wasteful spending. Twain made people laugh at the excesses of the rich. In 1889, Twain took on other members of the Establishment. He wrote A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, about a boy who travels back to the time of King Arthur. Twain made fun of those who were given advantages not because they had earned them but because of their family connections. If you have never read any of Mark Twain's works, try reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. They will make you laugh. \n Question: What do we learn about Mark Twain from the passage? \n Options: (A) He liked showing off by talking about his travels abroad. (B) He thought the rich should show mercy to the poor. (C) His lectures were very popular. (D) He supported those who succeeded with the help of others. \n Asnwer: A",

The planet, named OCLE-TR-56b, has temperatures of more than 3,000 degF. \"This is the hottest planet we know about,\" says Dr. Dimitar Sasselov, a scientist who led the discovery team, \"It is hot enough to have an iron fog and to rain hot iron droplets \" The new planet is 30 times farther away than any planet discovered by scientists before. It is in the Milky Way but it is not in our solar system The new planet moves around a star much like our sun, however. Scientists discovered the planet by using a new planet-searching method, called\"transit technique\" They were able to catch sight of the planet when it moved in front of its star, causing the star's light to dim .Scientists compare the method to discovering the shadow of a bee flying in front of a searchlight 200 miles away. \"We believe the door has been opened wide to go and discover planets like Earth,\" says Sasedlov. \n Question: We can infer from the passage that  _  . \n Options: (A) there is iron on the new planet (B) we could go to the new planet in winter (C) the star could block our view of the new planet (D) scientists are studying the weather on the new planet \n Asnwer: C",

Beyond the tremendous  loss of innocent lives and physical property, the attack was clearly aimed at the ideals of America--our values and the economic system that has made the U.S. economy the envy of the world. Those responsible for these acts portray the United States as the embodiment of all that is evil With globalization and the worldwide economy it has spawned. They use the failures of globalization as an excuse to exploit their millions of constituents in the underdeveloped world. Sometime soon, the U.S. military will strike back against those who it is determined have committed these acts. A military response is appropriate - some would say overdue . But even if the military objective is achieved, that alone will not get to the heart of the matter. It is crucial that the U.S. economy return to full speed ahead and continue to be the driving force behind expansion of the global economy. Globalization, or at least the present phase of it, generally is viewed as having started with the end of the Cold War in 1989. And for all its shortcomings, the free flow of goods, services, capital and labor across the borders of the world's trading nations -- the process that has come to be called globalization--still offers the best chance to fulfill the dreams of so many of the world's poor. \n Question: The attack on Sept. 11 caused   _  . \n Options: (A) loss to both the military forces and the ordinary citizens in the U.S. (B) a large variety of losses among the American people (C) greater loss to the American government than the citizens (D) less loss in the economy of the U.S. than the American ideals \n Asnwer: D",
