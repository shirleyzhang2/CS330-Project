    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). You need to output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent."
