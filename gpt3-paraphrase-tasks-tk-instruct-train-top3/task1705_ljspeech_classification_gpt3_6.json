        "This task is to read a paragraph and determine if it has any proper nouns in it. A proper noun is a noun that designates a particular being or thing, does not take a limiting modifier, and is usually capitalized in English. If there is at least one proper noun present in the paragraph, the answer is true. Otherwise, the answer is false."
