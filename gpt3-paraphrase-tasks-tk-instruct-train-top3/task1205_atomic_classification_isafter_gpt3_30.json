    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will receive two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether the Head happens after the Tail or not, and classify your answers into \"Yes\" or \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
