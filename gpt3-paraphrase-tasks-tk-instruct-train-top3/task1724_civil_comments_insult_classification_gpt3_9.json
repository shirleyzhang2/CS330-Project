Period.\nHillary is a strong supporter of health care: she brought the issue to the fore years ago where it remained.\nWomen's rights: she's been a champion of equal pay and other issues (Planned Parenthood) for decades.\nAfrican-Americans overwhelmingly support her. Do you know why?\nMinimum wage: $12. Not as high as Bern, but a large improvement.\nGun control: a decades' long supporter of toughening laws.\nImmigration: supporter of Obama.\nEducation: platform calls for free community college; debt-free public university attendance through $2500/year credit.\nSo, I don't know what you mean about her progressive ideas and credentials. Not as far as Bern, right, but a MASSIVE, MASSIVE difference from Trump.\nPlease, read this and learn a bit about her: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/hillary-clinton-believe-candidate-stands-10-issues/",
