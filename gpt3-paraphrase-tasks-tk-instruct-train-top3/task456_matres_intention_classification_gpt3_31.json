    "Definition": [
        "Given a context and a verb, you will have to determine if the verb implies an opinion, an intention or a wish. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional. The output will be 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, intention or wish, and 'No' otherwise."
