    "Definition": [
        "The input is a negotiation between two participants who are campsite neighbors. They are negotiating for Food, Water, and Firewood packages. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances, output Yes if the utterance contains the other-need strategy, otherwise output No. The other-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves."

'Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you. Then I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food. This is the lowest I can offer'",

I need it to cook my food and also to stay warm. What about you?'\nUtterance: 'That is the same for me as well.
