I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

I tried fixing it with the repair utility on the computer and it says there is nothing wrong! Properties says there is 72 GB of space used, but explorer says it is empty!!! Life is hectic for me, so I haven't had a chance to work with it much until recently, being past the return and support windows. I gave another one to a friend. Same thing!!! Junk!!! Absolute junk!!!
