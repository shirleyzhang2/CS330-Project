        "In this task, you will be given an English sentence. You need to output 'good' if the sentence is a valid representation of an anaphor number agreement. Output 'bad' if the sentence is not a valid representation of an anaphor number agreement. A valid representation of an anaphor number agreement is a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match in plurality."
