As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

I found Jack Walrath's (trumpet) performance pretty inspiring, but George Adams (sax) came off as a way over the top and annoying.  I think I'll go listen to Mingus Ah Um right now to wash the taste out of my mouth",

            "input": "A look into the life of Dale Earnhardt . Not being from the South, and only regularly watching Nascar beginning in 1997, my opinions may not quite be as objective or fact vs. fiction as others.     The movie gives us a look into the legendary NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt.  Starting with his upbringing in a small mill town by a tough as nails father who dies in his prime, Ralph, who races the dirt tracks.  It was rumored that noone could ever beat Ralph when he raced.    The story gives us an insight into Dales life up to his tragic Death on the track, while along the way showing us all the people who were a part of his life and a part of what made him be who he was.  From his father, to other racers, his wives and kids, and his special friendship with another driver who perished on the track, Neil Bonnet.  It also shows his reaqaintance with his first son, Cary.  Dale is perplexed to learn that Cary also worked in the same mill that his dad and him worked in, making Cary a 3rd generation mill worker.    It also has a great depiction of Dale Jr., how his stubborness as a teenager is met with a wall of eqaulity from his father, and how the two ended up racing together in the end.    Barry Pepper does an excellent job, I feel, of playing the role of the great racer.  The cast was done superbly for this movie  and given their limited budget, I have to give ESPN a \"2 thumbs up\" for their effort in bringing us a great story about a great individual of our time.    I always had the assumption Dale was a bit of a jerk, a grump, well this movie not only proved that wrong but showed me that the whole track can be filled with grumps when it comes to racing for the next dollar or meal.  Dale Waltrip is portrayed as an arrogant instigator to Earnhardt early in his career.    The second to last scene in the movie leaves us breathless as it shows the 4th turn on the final lap of the Daytona 500 that would ultimately be Dale's last race.  The final scene in the movie, outside of the mill, was very fitting, I won't give it away so watch it!",

            "input": "Not a Bad First Experience . Having moved overseas when my son was 8 months old, I have been pretty oblivious to what Blue's Clues was. Now that he's 18 months, I ordered this DVD to help him learn about shapes and colors. It's not a bad introduction to the world of Blue's Clues. I remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of Barney and I found Blue's Clues much more palatable. As for my son, he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes. It does keep his interest so definitely a winner",
