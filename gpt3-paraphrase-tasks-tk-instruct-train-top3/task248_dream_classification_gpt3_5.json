    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a conversation and a question. You will need to categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, or commonsense. A matching question is one that can be answered by a single sentence in the dialogue, and the answer can be extracted from that sentence. A summary question requires understanding the whole conversation in order to answer it, such as the topic of the conversation and the relation between the speakers. A logic question requires logical reasoning to answer it. An arithmetic question requires knowledge of arithmetic to answer it. A commonsense question requires knowledge that is not obtained from the dialogue itself, but from additional commonsense knowledge. Note that a question can be in more than one group."

            "input": "W: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.",

You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like? (A) He was pushed by the salesman (B) It was sold at a low price (C) It is the latest fashion.",

You should have told me that your sis had just broken up with a seven-foot gorilla named Butch. I mean the guy is huge, and he caught me dropping her at her place, and he nearly strangled me before I could get in my car. And the guy's dog. You might have warned me about his vicious beast dog. The thing nearly ripped off my arm. Well, once I peeled out of the drive way, the maniac started chasing me in his monster truck and nearly ran me off the road. And man, you could have told me that your car didn't have much gas 'cause it ran out in the middle of this dark parking lot, and I'm now hiding in the men's room of the gas station. Now, pick up the phone ... pick it up, ... Oh, no I can hear the guy outside and ... hey, and your phone is going dead ... Ah, man ... you might have told me that this thing couldn't hold a charge ... Ah man ... I should have stayed home and done the laundry ...
