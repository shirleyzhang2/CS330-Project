I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought this product again. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, 1 is an incorrect answer."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",
