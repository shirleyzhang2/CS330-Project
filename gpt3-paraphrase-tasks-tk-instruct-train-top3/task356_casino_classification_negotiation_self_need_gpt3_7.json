    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output No. self-need is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation, such as by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages."

'Yes, it would.' 'I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?'\nUtterance: 'You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.'",

That sounds pretty reasonable to me. I was going out with a bunch of my buddies. We like to hike a lot in the sun, so we need lots of water. How does it sound if i take all the food and water, but you get all the firewood?' 'I love hiking. My daughter is bringing extra water. So we could trade the water for the firewood. We do need just a little food as I didn't plan on having an extra person.'\nUtterance: 'Hmm, okay, that sounds reasonable.

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
