There are certain things I expect from a $50-a-night hotel, like the three people randomly hanging out on the sidewalk around the back corner of the first floor, cackling like hyenas at midnight for God only knows what reason. That's part of the experience. I signed up for that. That's on me.\\n\\nHere's what's on you:\\n\\n-- The soiled bath mat in the bathroom\\n-- The scab sitting in plain sight on the hot/cold knob in the shower\\n-- The nasty spots on the walls around the sink and toilet. Probably mold spores.\\n-- The dented-in towel rack in the bathroom.\\n\\nActually, strike that last one. The dented-in towel rack is on the hooker who worked out of Room 238 the night before and decided that was the only place to rest her 40-pound handbag. (For every one prostitute who finished college, like 2 or 3 don't. That's on her, not you Days Inn.)\\n\\nHere's what a good hotel would do: \\n\\n1. Fire the person who was responsible for stocking the towels and cleaning room 238 on Feb. 13. No sympathy, no questions, just a pink slip.\\n2. Install a proper ventilation system in the bathrooms so mold spores don't grow\\n3. You could bring the decor in the rooms out of 1989 too. That wouldn't hurt, but I'm not about to get greedy.\\n\\nI realize these things cost money, Days Inn, but I assume my $50 is going somewhere. Right?\\n\\nPositives:\\n-- Adequate water pressure in shower\\n-- There's a table\\n-- Two towels means I was able to use one of the towels as a bath mat since I was staying by myself.\\n\\nHell hole. Avoid it like the plague. Come to think of it, the scab might have contained the plague.",

            "input": "I bought a vehicle in late August at this dealership from salesman George. A few weeks later the paperwork for the registry was ready. When I picked up the paperwork at asked my salesman George point blank \\\"\"Is the Smog test all set?\\\"\" to which George assured me that it was. Well, the next day after sitting at the registry for two hours I get to the window and the person tells me the smog test IS NO GOOD, IT EXPIRED IN MARCH (6months ago, I can see if it expired recently but 6 months ago) so I just wasted 2 hrs of my time at that moment, so I call George up and said I was just at the registry and they told me the smog had expired in March. At that point I tell George what he had said the day before that he assured me the smog was all set, at that point       George puts me on hold and some guy named Donald is on the phone...wait a minute, George is the one that sold me the truck and GEORGE IS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME THE SMOG IS ALL SET NOT DONALD (let me just say this being in the customer service industry, if you are not 100% of an answer George you should not give a \\\"\"yes\\\"\" answer, you should have done YOUR due diligence in this matter since you were my salesman) so Donald gets on the phone and says the smog had \\\"\"just\\\"\" expired, at this point I get very pissed and tell Donald that this didn't \\\"\"just\\\"\" expire but it expired 6 months ago and that I had asked George specifically about the smog and was assured it was all set. Donald tells me I can go get my own smog and they will reimburse me, well after wasting MY TIME I get the smog, go back to the registry to have to wait another 3hr and 20min...so between the registry TWICE, getting the smog test,  and calling CARTWRIGHT MOTORS I have wasted over 6hrs of my time. So on Sept. 25 I emailed the smog test and some words stating what ordeal I had been put through, I didn't get my $15 check till over 3 WEEK LATER (I have the post date on the mailing envelope, Oct. 14th it was mailed out), nothing of an apology in there either and no follow-up from the Salesman regarding the smog, I CALLED YOU GEORGE, YOU WERE SUPPOSEDLY MY SALESMAN, you put me on hold for Donald, never heard from George again UNTIL last night, Thanksgiving, with a email stating \\\"\"We live and breathe by our reputation\\\"\" and that you will send me $100 for \\\"\"sending in  friend\\\"\". ARE YOU FRIGGING KIDDING ME, ........First if your \\\"\"reputation\\\"\" is so \\\"\"important\\\"\" this smog thing should have NEVER happened, You George should have taking 2min to look at that vehicles smog test to see if it expired BEFORE TELLING ME IT WAS ALL SET, if you were not 100% sure then you should not tell someone something that isn't right, that might help your \\\"\"reputation\\\"\"..and if you think I would EVER send any of my friends in there, WRONG, you and your company should have sent me that $100 for compensation for the time I had to waste because you and your co-workers \\\"\"dropped the ball\\\"\" even after I specifically was told it was all set...so your email states that if I was not 110% satisfy with your effort every step, I wouldn't even say I was 20% satisfied, but you should have already known that when I talked with you last...but I was put on hold, transferred to Donald (who by the way WAS NOT THE ONE WHO TOLD ME SMOG WAS ALL SET, IT WAS GEORGE) btw, Donald wasn't to understanding, he tried to play it off as the smog had \\\"\"just expired\\\"\", ummm 6 months ago is not JUST EXPIRED, so my guess is Donald was in charge of the smog...So George wanted me a write a review, here it is. I have all the documents and times to back up my claim if anyone wants to dispute this!!!",
