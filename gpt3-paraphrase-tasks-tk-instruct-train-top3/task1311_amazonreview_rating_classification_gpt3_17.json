I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought this product again. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, 1 is an incorrect answer."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

But there is a very strong alcohol smell when you open up the individual pack. Since almost all our glasses are made by some kind of poly-carbonate material, and so I am not so sure if that is safe for a long term usage for cleaning poly-carbonate lenses with the coatings.... \n Rating: 2",

The pattern is just printed on, as opposed to being woven, so the inside of the shirt has that white/washed-out look to it, and doesn't match the outside of the shirt. It's also a bit itchy. I may have paid $5 for this shirt if I saw it on a shelf but I certainly wouldn't have paid $18.99. I'll probably send it back, honestly. \n Rating: 2",
