I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

            "input": "Review: 2 stars because while it works as advertised and charges my phone perfectly, the design of the vent clip and ball joint make this overall unit far too heavy to keep your phone from flopping back and forth every time you turn your car. I supposed this could be a fault of the vent louvers themselves but other vent clip phone holders don\u2019t suffer from this problem because they hold the phone unit very close/flush against the vent itself....allowing very little side to side movement. By comparison, this design has the actual charger/phone holder being held out a full 3-4\u201d away from the vent. Good for airflow, but fails to serve the purpose of the unit itself as the phone will just flop back and forth constantly. Very annoying. Not recommended. \n Rating: 2",
