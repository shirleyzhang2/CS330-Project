He seems earnest and certainly this is a welcome exploration of the Trump phenomenon from a thoughtful source.\nToo bad no one has done a similar tome on the Obama presidency and the disasters it wrought. We could never expect this from a centrist Democrat, like Joe Manchin. The left is marching in lockstep and none of them would dare speak their minds.\nThis is a shame because in large part the Trump presidency is a Republican knee-jerk reaction to the calamity of Obama's eight years of malfeasance.",
