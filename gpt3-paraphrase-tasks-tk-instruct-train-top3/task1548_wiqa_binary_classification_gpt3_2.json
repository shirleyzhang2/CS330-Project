    "Definition": [
        "Given a set of steps describing a process, you need to answer the question 'Are the given steps in order?' Your answer must be either Yes or No. No means the steps are out of order and do not make sense in the order they are in. Yes means the steps are in order and make sense in the order that they are in. A set of steps are not in order if the steps reference information that is introduced in a later step."

            "explanation": "These steps are not in order. The first step in this sequence is 'The seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, etc' but the step introducing the seed 'A tree produces seeds' is after the steps referencing the seeds. Therefore, the answer is No"

            "explanation": "These steps are not in order. The first step is 'The nest is done'. Since these steps outline how birds make a nest, this step should be last. Therefore, the steps are out of order and the answer is No"

            "explanation": "This answer is incorrect because these steps are in order. The step, 'Acid rain is produced by chemicals that reach into the atmosphere' introduces the subject of the process, acid rain. The step 'Falls onto the ground' refers to the acid rain that was in the previous step. After the acid falls onto the ground, the next step is 'The acid rain starts scouring rocks'. The next step describes what happens after acid rain falls onto the ground, 'Destroys vegetation'. After the acid rain destroys vegetation, 'The lack of vegetation alters the surrounding environment.' Since each step only uses information from previous steps, the correct answer is Yes"
