    "Definition": [
        "You are given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head and Tail are events involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX may feel what is mentioned in the Tail. The feeling is an emotional reaction on the part of X or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, X might feel good about [one]self. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
