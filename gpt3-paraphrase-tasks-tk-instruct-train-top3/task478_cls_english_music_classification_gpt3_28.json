            "input": "boring.... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell.",

            "input": "Start here if you're new to Branford . This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since.  I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so",
