I personally consider Muslims in the same category as a rabid skunk. They are both dangerous and unpredictable. One thing for sure is Muslims either kill or watch you be killed. They will never come to your defense. They are brainwashed as children by their Quran which demands that they lie about their intentions until they are in great  enough numbers to kill or enslave the infidels as the Quran tells them to. Mohammed their prophet was a pedophile and a mass murder. Islam does not fit my definition of religion. Does your religion ordered you to kill or enslave people not of your religion? Is it ok to lie about your true intentions? If you answered no then you are a civilized person and Islamophobia is common sense,",
