    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of five sentences. The second sentence will be missing, and you will be given a candidate sentence to fill in the blank. You need to determine if the candidate sentence connects the first sentence to the rest of the story. If it does, indicate your answer with \"Yes\". If it does not, indicate your answer with \"No\". The candidate sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, such that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
