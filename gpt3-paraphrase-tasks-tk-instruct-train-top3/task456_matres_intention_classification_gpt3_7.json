        "You will receive a context and a verb, separated with a newline character. You need to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, a wish or not. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). Output 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish; and 'No' otherwise."
