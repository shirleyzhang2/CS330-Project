            "input": "What a great little place!  The fresh baked break and sandwiches made with meat sliced to order are just perfect.  The sandwiches are really big and reasonably priced for the size, easily enough for 2 people to share, especially if you save room for dessert, which you definitely should do.  There is a lovely dessert case with lots of pretty things inside.  So far I have tried 5 different pastries, and all have been really good.  Not the best desserts I have ever had, but definitely very tasty. The only drawback is very slow service.  There was only one man working up front the day we tried lunch, and he was making all of the sandwiches himself.  Since everything is made to order, this is not the place to go if you are in a rush, but if you have the time it is worth the wait.",

Te place was clean an it was full but they REALLY need more servers service was very slow and the food came one plate at a time. We had the \\\"\"del Rey\\\"\" torta because of how famous it is but it OVER RATED! It was bland and super greasy. The queso fundido and the aguas frescas were the BEST thing very good !!! Tacos NOT good at all and the refried beans I won't even go there. But they do serve a LOT of food for the price!",
