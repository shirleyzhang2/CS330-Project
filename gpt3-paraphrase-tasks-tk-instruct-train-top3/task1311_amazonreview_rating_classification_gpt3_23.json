I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

I had it in my front pocket, took it out and the corner was cracked. Nothing else was in my pocket so I was kinda perplexed on how that was even possible. I went to install the 2nd one and it would not apply without bubbles so I just gave up. I've installed many different types of screen protectors so it wasn't user error, it just constantly bubbled like there was something stuck to the bottom of it. Would be helpful if they also provided a frame to assist with installation. Not thrilled, going to order elsewhere at this point since now I have no screen protector. \n Rating: 2",
