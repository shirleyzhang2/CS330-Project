    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a sentence. You should determine whether it is an overruling or non-overruling sentence. In law, an overruling sentence nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. If the sentence is an overruling sentence, output 'overruling'. If the sentence is a non-overruling sentence, output 'non-overruling'."
