    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The possible types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. The first word in the pair will be denoted by 'X', and the second word will be denoted by 'Y'. A 'COORD' relationship holds when 'X' and 'Y' belong to the same semantic class. A 'HYPER' relationship applies when 'X' is a specific instance of 'Y'. If neither 'COORD' nor 'HYPER' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
