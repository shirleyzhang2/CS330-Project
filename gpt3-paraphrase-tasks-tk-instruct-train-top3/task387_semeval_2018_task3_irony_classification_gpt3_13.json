    "Definition": [
        "In this task you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. You must classify the type of irony the tweet has. The tweets will be labeled as (\"polarity\",\"situational\",\"other\") based on the irony they have. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. These instances will be labeled as \"situational\". Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. These instances will be labeled as \"polarity\". There are other kinds of ironies that are neither polarity nor situational. These instances will be labeled as \"other\". Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
