    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. An overruling sentence nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Classify your answers into overruling or non-overruling."
