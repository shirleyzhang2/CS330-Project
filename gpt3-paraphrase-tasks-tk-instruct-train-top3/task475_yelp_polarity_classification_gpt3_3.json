If only it didn't close at 1am you could probably have your entire night out in the one place.\\n\\n\\n Situated above the Cafe Royal the very well stocked bar makes great use of its period features with black walls and gold cornices and a DJ in the corner plays tunes that add to ambience without forcing you to raise your voice to have a conversation.\\n\\n\\n The huge selection of spirits indicates that mixed drinks are a speciality here and I've never been dissapointed yet. \\nIt make a pleasant change to be able to order a spirit without having it poured into an inappropriately sized glass and drowned in whatever mixer is chosen.\\n\\n\\n Whilst entry to the bar is free of charge the DJs and live acts perform in the ballroom for an additional fee. The room boasts a good souns system and a decent sized dancefloor. Get in early if you want to bag a table though!",

            "input": "I just returned from a work team sponsored lunch at this location. The atmosphere and everything was amazing, but that's about where that ends. Our server was pretty short with us the whole time, not very warm, not welcoming. It was later explained to us that it was his last day serving... I guess he just stopped caring a little early for the occasion or something then. So service aside... let's get to food.\\n\\nThere were four of us and only half of us were satisfied with the food.  Maybe I expected more from my $16 burger, but so much of it wasn't right. I ordered it \\\"\"extra well done\\\"\" (I actually said \\\"\"I like it charred...) and \\\"\"with no bun\\\"\" - it came out medium-well on a bun. A colleague of mine was sold on the Cuban sandwich... and he, too, was underwhelmed with it. Another coworker, who has a gluten-intolerance, ordered her burger bunless as well... it came out on on a bun, too. Maybe it was just our server not caring, but when you see a table that has two empty buns sitting on appetizer plates, perhaps a simple \\\"\"Oh, I'm sorry about that.\\\"\" should  be muttered.\\n\\nWe got none of that. I've been here before and it was a much better experience. This one, well, was just \\\"\"meh.\\\"\"  IF I ever go back, I'll adjust this accordingly.",

This is probably why they could not find the bottle we ordered for 15minutes. Then had no idea how to serve it. The courses gets served on top of each other as if they need to get you out of there. Order the lobster ravioli and it tastes like fish sticks. Order the mushroom ravioli and it comes out like a plate of hot stew.  You can't tell what is the ravioli and what the burnt bits are.....bluntly...it was a mess.  I give one star because the bread is good, although oddly they leave a bottle of olive olive oil on the table straight from the store.....next to the crayons they have on the table so the server can write his name on the paper table cloth for you to remember. Come on.  Meal for two was $102 with wine and apps.  This place was a lot better a few years ago....now they can't even get the lighting right. Dump.",
