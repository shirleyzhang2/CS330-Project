            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive (even though there is a negative phrase as part of the review). The right label should be 'POSITIVE' and not 'NEGATIVE'."

But based on the taste of the food the small portions aren't a bad thing. I had the beef tacos. They were four mini beef tacos (served with no side whatsoever), the meat was extremely dry. The only way to salvage them was to dump loads of salsa and sour cream on them. I also ordered what the menu said was a pina colada I took one sip and immediately pushed it to the side (they had the courtesy to not charge me for it). All in all it was a really bad experience and I would not go there again nor recommend this place to anyone.\\nTo be avoided",

Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs. But my real gripe was the glasses. They were filthy. All of them. I couldn't use them, they just put me off. The inside of the glasses had this build up of grime and dirt on them.  I won't be going to this place again.",

Jose came to the house within 45 minutes and was able to find the leak and fix it within 20 minutes...simply amazing!!!!! Fast affordable and polite, it's refreshing to know that there is honest and fair company's doing business in the las vegas summerlin area. If you need help call mc and ask for jose!",
