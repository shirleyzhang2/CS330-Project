    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, your task is to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head. If The Tail is the reason for the Head, output \"Yes\". If The Tail is not the reason for the Head, output \"No\". The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
