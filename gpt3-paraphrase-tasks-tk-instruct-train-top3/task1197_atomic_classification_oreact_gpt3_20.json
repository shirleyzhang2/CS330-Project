    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Tail event is a feeling that is a result of the Head event. For example, if the Head event is gift-giving, the Tail event might be feeling appreciated. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
