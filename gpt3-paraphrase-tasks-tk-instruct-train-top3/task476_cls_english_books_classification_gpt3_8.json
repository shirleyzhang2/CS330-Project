            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",
            "output": "NEG",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer mentions negative expressions such as 'nothing happens', 'why write a book' etc), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "A Darker Phineas Finn . In PHINEAS FINN, Anthony Trollope wrote about a happy-go-lucky young Irish Member of Parliament who romances the ladies and achieves a minor ministerial rank in the Liberal government. A dispute with his party regarding the Irish question, however, results in his leaving politics and returning to Ireland.    PHINEAS REDUX brings Phineas back, but the slogging is now harder. The vicious infighting between Daubeny (Disraeli) and Gresham (Gladstone) has soured Phineas somewhat. He is repeatedly slandered by a yellow journalist named Quintus Slide; and many in his party, including some of his friends, believe that the Irishman is carrying on an adulterous affair with Lady Laura Kennedy. At one point, the aggrieved husband takes a pot shot at Phineas, but misses. Matters turn still darker when J. Bonteen, a political rival to Phineas, is murdered one night in the street shortly after a quarrel with Phineas at the Universe Club.    The major set piece of PHINEAS REDUX is the trial of Phineas Finn for the murder of Bonteen. Opinion is evenly split on the question of his guilt and the issue seems to be in doubt until Mme Max Goesler, whose love Finn had rejected in the earlier volume, conducts her own investigation and produces evidence that turns the tide and results in a resounding acquittal.    If Trollope were a lesser author, everything at this point would be all sweetness and light. Here, however, Phineas suffers what appears to be a nervous breakdown and contemplates pulling out of politics altogether. What Trollope presents us with is an updated version of the Book of Job, with the difference that Phineas averts his face from his new good fortune and concentrates on his losses. His good friends rally round the young M.P. and slowly wean him from his depression.     The pot of gold at the end of this dark rainbow is Mme Max. Phineas proposes to the wealthy young widow and is accepted",

            "input": "A Deceiving Title . This sounds like an ideal book for a person with an eating disorder.  But it heaps loads of guilt and condemnation on an already needy and suffering soul.  The idea that over or undereating is sin is one concept.  But the fact is that the individuals embroiled in this cannot help themselves. They are already people pleasers and perfectionists, how can telling them the whole problem is because they are sinners be of help? They are already as good as they can get themselves to be. They are not bad--they are hurt and afraid. It has been said no one can overcome an eating disorder without the help of a therapist.  This I believe.  There are too many important issues involved in this DISEASE to dismiss it as sin.  If the person knew the issues they would be a long way to getting help. God loves these dear ones and understands the enormity of their situation and their pain. These are very good people. Heaping more condemnation on one beset with self-loathing is surely not the path to freedom.  Adding God's displeasure to this already mountainous pile of self hate can only be damaging--perhaps pushing some over the edge.  A good book to avoid!!",

            "input": "Patterson's Second Worst? . I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.     Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books.",
