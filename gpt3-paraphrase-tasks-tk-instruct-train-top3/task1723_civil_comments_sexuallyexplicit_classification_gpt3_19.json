The Supreme Court  acknowledges that libel is actionable per se (without money damage or special harm) if false information is published in a written form (like this site).  They then wander off to the Supreme Court and 9th Circuit opinions and decide that in spite of all that, basically that \u201ctwo-faced,\u201d \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201crude.\u201d were not 'provably false' and based on all the facts and circumstances, protected by the 1st Amendment, in the facts of  this case.
