        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. You need to output Yes if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output No. vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be through an explicit call out or can be implied."
