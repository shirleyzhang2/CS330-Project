this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg 's star - making role in boogie nights .\nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone .\ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me .\nhe 's all wrong for a lead role , but it does n't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters .\nby the end of 54 , shane 's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent .\nthe rest of the performances are wasted .\nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here .\nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard .\nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher 's wading - pool of a script .\nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .\nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him .\ni 've read that studio 54\nhas been recreated down to the last detail .\nfrankly , i do n't care .\nit 's easy to recreate something technical like this .\na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task .\nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . aside from myers ' performance , 54 is a complete failure .\nit 's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .\nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they 're so obvious to me .\nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast .\nit does n't even work as mindless entertainment : it 's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it .\nso , do n't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .\neverything else i said was just padding .",
