The Nazi party came to elected power for the exact same reason Trump has control of the GOP agenda, blame someone else.  Hitler's propaganda machine headed by a newspaper man, Goebbels, spewed out the same drumbeat and faux facts as Fox News or The Rushbo does for the last 16 yrs.  We will get the government we deserve unless some of our voters actually get their news from any other sources than Fox or Newsmax.  Read a book, I would suggest \"The Rise and Fall of the 3rd Reich\"",
