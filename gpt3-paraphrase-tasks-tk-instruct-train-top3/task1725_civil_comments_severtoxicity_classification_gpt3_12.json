Yeah, because I want to spend 2500+ to share a thin wall with my roommate.  Oh, and I want to pick between a dining table OR living room set, because in this modern world you can't have both.  And if you do want both, one is going to be in a tiny spot by your door and the other is going to be down a long hallway of useless square ft next to your kitchenette.

I feel that is the main reason people do not want to give up or reduce their PFD.  There probably wouldn't be as much resistance if we had a legislature that we could trust to spend it wisely.  The legislature has no concept of managing money, they are irrational and crazy-making.  Cut all these services and jobs yet buy the LIO???  Sounds very self-centered and selfish to me.",
