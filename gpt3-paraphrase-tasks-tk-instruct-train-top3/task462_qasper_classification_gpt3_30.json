    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your task is to classify the question as \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\". Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts from the context into a summary. Abstractive questions require paraphrasing the context using new sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

Taking $m\\times m$ grids as a region, with $s$ grids as the stride, we obtain $n\\times n$ regions, where $n=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{g-m}{s}\\right\\rfloor +1$ . We then feed the regions to a pre-trained ResNet BIBREF24 deep convolutional neural network to produce $n\\times n\\times d_I$ -dimensional region features, where $d_I$ is the dimension of feature from the layer before the last fully-connected layer. \n Question: Does the new system utilize pre-extracted bounding boxes and/or features?",
