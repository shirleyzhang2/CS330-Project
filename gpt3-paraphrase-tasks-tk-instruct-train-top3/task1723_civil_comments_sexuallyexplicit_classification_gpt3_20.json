He promoted a fiscal plan that fairly spread the pain of the fiscal crisis.  He wrote it in pencil. He solicited input.  He marched it around the state.  He got broad public support.  The cornerstone of his plan is fairness.  I know this first hand; I spoke to him about it myself.\n\nThen, the Body, which created the fiscal mess, comes back with SB128- putting the fiscal burden on every man, woman, and CHILD in the state. PFD reform is not a good stand alone answer. The public will not abide a PFD raid; perceived or real!\n\nTo make matters worse, the Governor applauds the enemy when he needs to go right back for support to his strongest constituency, the general public and demand a better fiscal plan.\n\nThis constitutes a sad political strategy to shift the blame from the GOP, to the governor.\n\nPaybacks are a bitch",
