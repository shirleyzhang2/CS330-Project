        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. Your task is to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. A Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no."

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

            "input": "We use the LSTM network as follows. The $x$ vector is fed through the LSTM network which outputs a vector $\\overrightarrow{h_i}$ for each time step $i$ from 0 to $n-1$. This is the forward LSTM. As we have access to the complete vector $x$, we can process a backward LSTM as well. This is done by computing a vector $\\overleftarrow{h_i}$ for each time step $i$ from $n-1$ to 0. Finally, we concatenate the backward LSTM with the forward LSTM:\n\nBoth $\\overrightarrow{h_i}$ and $\\overleftarrow{h_i}$ have a dimension of $l$, which is an optimized hyperparameter. The BiLSTM output $h$ thus has dimension $2l\\times n$. \n Question: Is the LSTM bidirectional?",

These polarity scores of words are computed as in (DISPLAY_FORM4). For example, if a review consists of five words, it would have five polarity scores and we utilise only three of these sentiment scores as mentioned. Lastly, we concatenate these three scores to the averaged word vector per review.\n\nThat is, each review is represented by the average word vector of its constituent word embeddings and three supervised scores. We then feed these inputs into the SVM approach. The flowchart of our framework is given in Figure FIGREF11. When combining the unsupervised features, which are word vectors created on a word basis, with supervised three scores extracted on a review basis, we have better state-of-the-art results. \n Question: Which hand-crafted features are combined with word2vec?",
