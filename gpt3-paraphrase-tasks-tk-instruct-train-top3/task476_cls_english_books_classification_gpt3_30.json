            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",
            "output": "NEG",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "Great premise, unfulfilled, but not for lack of pages . I read this after enjoying Iles' \"Footprints of God\" quite a bit.  This is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise.  The book is lengthy, and repeats itself quite a bit (due, I assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters).  Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.    After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.    There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of \"why?\" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.    All that being said, the last page of the epilogue is brilliant, and in it, I found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord.",

As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter.  I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate.  I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays.  I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.",
