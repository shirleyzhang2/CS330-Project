            "input": "Matrixx Initiatives is the company who makes the Zicam cold remedies.   I recently found the nasal gel to be effective in terms of shortening and lessening my cold symptoms.   And I've not experienced diminished sense of smell as had been reported in a class action suit from 2006.  [Link]   But I tried using the Oral Mist, Mint flavor as an alternative to the Nasal Spray - seemed more dignified than the nasal gel during a recent all-day business meeting.   I stopped using the product after two days of use because it left a lingering metallic-sour flavor in the mouth.   A mild sense of nausea is also present.  It's been a day since discontinuing use, and these symptoms have not diminished to any degree.   So my cold has gone away for the most part, but overall I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth with this product.",

            "input": "Yep, found my new go-to healthy spot.  Rachel's Kitchen who?\\n\\nI am so excited Daily Kitchen took over the space recently vacated by Rachel's Kitchen.  It has a similar, health focused menu and will delight those looking for fresh, organic dining.  Menu selections include healthy pastas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, breakfast, juices and burgers.  \\n\\nI'd highly recommend their bean burger ($7.50).  The burger comes with a black bean patty and caramelized onions on a whole-wheat bun.  This wasn't your typical freezer section black bean patty--it tasted homemade. It was phenomenal.  The bun was also warm and homemade--another win!\\n\\nEach of the burgers come with a salad, fruit or sweet potato fries.  I enjoyed my side salad but the dressing (I think it was some type of vinaigrette) was pretty bland.  I'd prefer more seasoning in the dressing.\\n\\nThe Ahi Ahi tacos were also pretty good but, at $9.50, I wish they came with some type of side.  Three small tacos sitting in the middle of a large plate was less than visually appealing. I felt bad for the tacos, they looked so pathetic and small.  However, the tacos were nicely prepared (although slightly underseasoned) and the tuna was good quality.  I'm not sure I'd order this again.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back to try their organic breakfasts and juices (and eat 500 more black bean burgers).  They better not move!\\n\\nAlso, please note: DK is a yuppie magnet.  You have been warned.",
