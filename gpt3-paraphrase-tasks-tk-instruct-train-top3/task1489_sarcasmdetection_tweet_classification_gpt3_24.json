        "Given a tweet in English, you are expected to classify the post into one of two classes: sarcastic or non-sarcastic. A sarcastic sentence is one that uses words that mean the opposite of what the speaker really wants to say, often in order to insult someone, or to show irritation, or just for amusement."
