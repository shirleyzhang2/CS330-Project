    "Definition": [
        "You are given a tweet that contains irony, and you must classify the type of irony. The types are \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\". To label the tweets, first determine if the irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. If so, it's \"polarity\" irony. If the irony is due to a situation failing to meet some expectations, it's \"situational\" irony. If it's neither of those, it's \"other\" irony."
