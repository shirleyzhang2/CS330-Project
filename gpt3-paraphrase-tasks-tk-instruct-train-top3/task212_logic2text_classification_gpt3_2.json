        "In this task, you are given a command in terms of logical operations. Your job is to classify the command into one of seven categories: majority, unique, superlative, count, comparative, aggregation, or ordinal. 1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column 6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows."

            "explanation": "The less command indicates the comparision between rows, hence, 'comparative' category is right, but the label is 'ordinal' which is wrong."
