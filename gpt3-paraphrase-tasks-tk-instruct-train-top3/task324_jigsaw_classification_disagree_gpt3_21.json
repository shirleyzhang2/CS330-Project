        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree if it is not likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

        {
            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The topic of climate change conspiracy is controversial. This comment expresses the user's disbelief of climate change, which is against the general consensus. Thus, this comment is likely to raise public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

That is a completly false narrative that is not supported by facts.\n\nThe budget deficits Alaska suffers come mainly from the fact we are giving away almost $10 billion dollars of oil per year tax- free  due to the blatently unconstitutional and corrupt SB-21.\n\nIf we continue to give away our oil, we WILL destroy the Alaska economy and wipe out the personal wealth of the majority of Alaskans.",
