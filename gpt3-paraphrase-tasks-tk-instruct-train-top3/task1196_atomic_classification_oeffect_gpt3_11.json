    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head is the event that happens first, and Tail is the event that happens after Head. You have to determine whether, as a result of Head, the subject of Tail (PersonY) will be affected as mentioned in Tail, or not. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. For example, if the Head event is \"X gets hugged\", and the Tail event is \"Y blushes in response\", then the answer would be \"Yes\". Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
