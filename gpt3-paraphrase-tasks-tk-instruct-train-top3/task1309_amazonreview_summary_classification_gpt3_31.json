I'm curious how the delivery driver can take a picture of the delivery at the wrong address, identified in the photos, and Amazon's only solution is to refund my $$.

Moving that button to a reasonable location would have made this a five-star item. Sounds trivial perhaps, but it is a constant annoyance every time I use it. You'd think after 6 weeks you'd find a routine that gets around this issue but it is so poorly placed that it's impossible to avoid. My strong advice is to choose something else. \n Summary: Flavor is light - Like it- top $$ for amount of product",
