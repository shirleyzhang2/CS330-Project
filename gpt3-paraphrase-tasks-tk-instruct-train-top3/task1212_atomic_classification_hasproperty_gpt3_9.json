        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>, determine whether the Head can be characterized by being or having the Tail. Being characterized usually describes entities' general characteristics or subjective attributes. It can also map to descriptors that speak to the substance or value of items. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
