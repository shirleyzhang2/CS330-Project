As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is negative as the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'insult', 'degrades', 'does not deserve', 'disgusting' etc. Hence, the label is 'NEG'."

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "explanation": "As these reviews are written by people, they may have typos and grammatical issues. Here the word \"boring\" is missplled, but it is still obvious that the review is a negative one."

    "Negative Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

        {
            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",
            "output": "NEG",
            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive as the reviewer refers to the dvd with positive expressions such as 'good piece of work', 'excellent' etc. The right label should be 'POS' and not 'NEG'."

Also to Acorn \"jcorn59483\"  Blalock is described as \"Genius and Unbridled Ambition and    Taylor is described as \"loyal and dedication\"   ???   Did you see the same movie as the rest of us.  Or are you unaware of your own unconscious prejudices??   Also to another reviewer Did not Taylor have a Major contribution to the valve that saved the life of blue babies ???  Maybe I should see the movie again.  You gave the credit to Blalock and some other Caucasian Doctor  Only  ??     Racism and Prejudices are such complexities of the \"American Life\"  Some of us live it every day and say \"What!... Not Me!  While others live and deal with it every day!  How obsurd to call the genius of Vivien Taylor \"loyal and dedicated\"  This man had No formal medical training yet he went toe to toe with a Doctor who was at the top of his field.  Who was the real genius here  !",
