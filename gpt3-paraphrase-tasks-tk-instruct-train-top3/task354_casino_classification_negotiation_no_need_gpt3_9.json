    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, implying that the item is up for grabs."
