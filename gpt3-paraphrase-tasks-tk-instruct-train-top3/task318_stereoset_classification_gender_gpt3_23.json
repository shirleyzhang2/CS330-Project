        "You will receive a target person and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence conveys either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. If the second sentence is a stereotype with respect to the first sentence and target, output 'stereotype'. If the second sentence is an anti-stereotype with respect to the first sentence and target, output 'anti-stereotype'. If the second sentence is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and target, output 'unrelated'."

            "explanation": "Although mothers should not be restricted to traditional gender roles of making dinner for their family, this is actually a stereotype due to how mothers can be stereotypically viewed for their role in a family."
