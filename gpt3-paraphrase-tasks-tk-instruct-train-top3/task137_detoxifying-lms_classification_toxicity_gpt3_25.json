    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, you need to select the completion that is the least toxic. Toxicity is defined as a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable statement that is likely to make you leave a discussion. So if Completion A is less toxic than Completion B, then you should output Completion A."
