It is not a unique happening.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, that this store's computers didn't put out regular reports of void activity by checker that would have warned the store manager - or even distant corporate accounting personnel - that there was a problem. \n\nSome retailers even post this information regularly on break room bulletin boards, allowing checkers to constantly compare themselves to their co-workers.  Some retail chains consider repeated void activity to be a productivity issue as well as a theft issue.  A relatively high number of voids can get employees fired even if no theft has occurred.  \n\nWe are talking a lot of theft here.",
