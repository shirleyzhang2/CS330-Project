As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "Superb value package . If Bette Davis is not remembered as the best actress to come out of Hollywood in the Golden Era, she certainly was thought so at the time and this package easily demonstrates the range of her talent. This set, compared to Volume One, which contains obvious Davis hits, covers a wider period of her career from 1937 to 1962. Two favourite Davis films, \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" and \"Marked Woman\" are included.      More detailed reviews of each of these films can be viewed under their individual titles so by way of a quick summary:    - \"Marked Woman\" is a sensational 1937 film about prostitutes who go to court to get their gangster pimp incriminated.  This was the first film Davis made after she walked out of Warner Brothers and was sued for breach of contract.  She lost and returned to the studio but with a new found respect. She gives an intense performance and the film is very exciting with a great downbeat ending.  - \"Jezebel\" is the 1938 film for which Davis won her second Oscar, a precursor to \"Gone with the Wind\" and directed superbly by William Wyler.  The film is a soap opera about a willful Southern girl and would fall into trivia without Davis's subtle performance and Wyler's attention to detail.  - \"Dark Victory\" from 1939 was possibly Davis's favourite role about a Long Island socialite with a brain tumour. The film is a tour de force for Davis who might have won another Oscar if the film had been released in a different year.  - \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\" is an ensemble piece, an excellent version of the 1941 Kaufman and Hart Broadway Hit.  Davis supports Monty Woolley, a character based on Alexander Woolcott, who hilariously dominates the film.  - \"Old Acquaintance\" from 1943 maybe the quintessential woman's picture with Davis starring with rival Miriam Hopkins.  It is a picture which resonated with \"woman's issues\" in 1943 and was remade in the 80's as \"Rich and Famous\".  - \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\" is the famous teaming with Joan Crawford in a baroque tragedy which has become a cult (and camp) classic. The film was shot on a small budget and in 3 weeks and it shows.    The extras alone make up hours of additional viewing which enhance the films immeasurably, although some of the commentaries are poor with far too much gossip about Davis's overanalysed relationship with Joan Crawford. Best of all, the excellent documentary \"Stardust: The Bette Davis Story\" has been included.  The Collection is great value",

The man has many a good movies in his filmography  this is certainly not one of them !!!!!!!!",
