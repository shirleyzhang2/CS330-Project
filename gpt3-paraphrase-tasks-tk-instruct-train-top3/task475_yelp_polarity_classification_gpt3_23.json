            "input": "Thoroughly underwhelming. Crispy overdone meat, mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor.  Bobby Flay's place across the street should not worry. The only spark of innovation they have is a hamburger that's well over a pound.",

            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive (even though there is a negative phrase as part of the review). The right label should be 'POSITIVE' and not 'NEGATIVE'."

Also, it is definitely better priced and is bigger than the other location which is in the Palazzo Shops on the second floor right on the strip.\\n\\nMy alumni club hosted a fashionably dress to impress Kentucky Derby party at this venue. The restaurant had a fine selection of wine for our wine junkies and was also able to change up their bar with bourbon offerings such as Woodford Reserve Double Oak for our special event. Mint julips were on point and meals were reasonably priced.",

I thought the food was ok - nothing to write home about...The omakase was totally not worth the $150 per person.
