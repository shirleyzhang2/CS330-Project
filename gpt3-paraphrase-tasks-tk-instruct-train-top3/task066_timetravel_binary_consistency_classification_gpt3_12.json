        "In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You are given a candidate sentence for the second sentence, and you need to determine if it connects the first sentence to the rest of the story. Answer \"Yes\" if it connects, and \"No\" if it does not. The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
