        "In this task, you are given a short passage. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, and unrelated. If the passage conveys a stereotype, classify it as 'stereotype'. If the passage goes against a common stereotype, classify it as 'anti-stereotype'. If the passage does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype, classify it as 'unrelated'."
