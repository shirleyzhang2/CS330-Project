They have had every Native from around the area on telling us all what a wonderful community member the deceased is.  I remember the day after it happened, they had the brother on for about 5 minutes telling the native side of the story, the mother has been on telling how bad the Police were.......yada yada yada.........and this case is just making it to court now.  How is our Public Broadcaster allowed to use our tax dollars to interfere and again, try to influence public opinion- giving only one side of the story?   And it is a case before the courts, normally that  was a no go area for media.....apparently not anymore.",
