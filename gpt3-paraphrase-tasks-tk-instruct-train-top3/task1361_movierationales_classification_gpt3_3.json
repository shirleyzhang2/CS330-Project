            "input": "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .\nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .\nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .\nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .\nin other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .\ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?\nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .\nit 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .\nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .\nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .\ni do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .\nin the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .\nit 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .\nand from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) .\ndo n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .\nnow onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .\nthe print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so\nno comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )\nably captures the dreariness of victorian - era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black - and - white comic .\noscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .\neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .\nians holm ( joe gould 's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians )\nlog in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .\ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually was n't half bad .\nthe film , however , is all good .\n2\n: 00 - r for strong violence / gore , sexuality , language and drug content",
