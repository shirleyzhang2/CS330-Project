Most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods. This writer's stories concerned the daily ordeals of a boy living with his family on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya, and the horrific plight of a Rwandan girl whose mother is Tutsi and father Hutu. Not only did the applicant have what writers call \"material,\" he was blessed with an uncanny ear for human speech and the poetry to describe his characters' very unpoetic lives. I can still remember the young Kenyan boy watching his mother decant the glue she intends to sniff. The glue, the boy tells us, \"glowed warm and yellow in the dull light,\" and when his mother had poured enough, \"she cut the flow of the glue by tilting the tin up. The last stream of gum entering the bottle weakened and braided itself before tapering in midair like an icicle.\"Eileen Pollack: There was concern about Uwem Akpan's application to a writing programShe says he fit in well and his talent soon became evidentAkpan's blessed with great talent for hearing people and with poetic writing ability, she saysHis book of stories about African children has been selected by Oprah's book club \n Questions:Then, a year later, it published a revised version of the story about the half-_, half-Hutu Rwandan girl.
