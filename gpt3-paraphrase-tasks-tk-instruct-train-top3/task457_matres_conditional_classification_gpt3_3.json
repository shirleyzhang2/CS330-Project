        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. Your task is to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action. A verb is hypothetical if it involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. A verb is conditional if it appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else. If the verb is conditional or hypothetical, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, output \"No\"."
