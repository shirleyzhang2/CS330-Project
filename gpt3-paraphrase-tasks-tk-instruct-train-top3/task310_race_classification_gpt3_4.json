            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now. But I hope more smiling faces will be drawn on it. \n Questions: When has the poem been written? \n Options: (A) At the beginning of the last semester. (B) At the end of the year.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them. (C) Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy. (D) Because many reporters have shown the problem of the systems. \n Answer: D",

            "input": "Article: Proverbs are popular around the world. Many proverbs give advice on how to live. Some proverbs are hundreds of years old, but they are still used today. For example, my son is just like his father in many ways. We often say the two of them prove the proverb that the apple does not fall far from the tree. My daughter is very short. She would like to be taller. But I tell her that good things come  in small packages. Some valuable things are very small, like diamonds and other jewels. But I also tell my children that all that glitters is not gold. Something may look valuable, but may not really be valuable. Also, I tell them do not judge a book by its cover. You should not judge something only by its appearance. Sometimes I tell my children to cooperate to solve a problem. After all, two heads are better than one. But another proverb says too many cooks spoil the soup. If too many people try to do something, then the job will not be done well. I also tell my children that two wrongs do not make a right. You should not do something bad just because someone did the same to you. Some people are pessimists while other people are optimists. Pessimists always think about  how bad things are or will be; optimists might say that every cloud has a silver lining and they always look on the bright side. Other people are both pessimists and optimists. They hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Some people often worry about what they will do in a situation that might happen in the future. We could tell them do not cross that bridge until you come to it. It is usually much better to prevent a problem from happening than it is to find ways to solve it.So we say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \n Question: The author often comforts her daughter with the proverb that   _  . \n Options: (A) the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

The people are unfriendly, it's way too expensive, and the food is terrible - so why do so many tourists flock   there? London was named the world's most popular city between July and September 2013. It _ other world-famous cities such as New York and Paris, welcoming 4.9 million visitors, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. Amazingly, this was an increase of almost 19.5 percent on 2012 - the year when the Olympics happened in summer. So can London's success be explained? Well, maybe. As the English writer Samuel Johnson once said, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\". London life is often crazy and expensive, but if you can think of something, you can probably do it there. Anywhere in the city, you can often look around a great museum such as the British Museum, watch a concert at a historic venue   like the Royal Albert Hall, or dance the night away in a cool nightclub such as Fabric. And it's not just about culture - there are also world-famous sporting venues around the city. Many tourists like to watch soccer matches at stadiums such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, or Tottenham's White Hart Lane. Tourists even came to watch British tennis player Andy Murray's famous victory at the Wimbledon tennis tournament   in 2013. Yes, but what about the food? Well, even if you don't like British food - and if you've never had real fish and chips, or a summer pudding, then perhaps you should wait until you've tried them - there is plenty of great food from all over the world available in London's many restaurants. London, like many of its buildings, has a long history, but also never lacks a vibrant pulse  . All over the city, history and modernity come together to make it an essential place for tourists to discover. \n Question: What is the author's main purpose in writing the article? \n Options: (A) To show the effects of the 2012 London Olympics. (B) To analyze why London appeals to tourists. (C) To compare London with other world-famous cities. (D) To talk about common problems in London. \n Asnwer: A",
