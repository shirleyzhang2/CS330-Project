            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now. But I hope more smiling faces will be drawn on it. \n Questions: When has the poem been written? \n Options: (A) At the beginning of the last semester. (B) At the end of the year.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them. (C) Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy. (D) Because many reporters have shown the problem of the systems. \n Answer: D",

            "input": "Article: Without any previous notice, a documentary dominated headlines and social websites over the weekend. Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28. It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference. Chai, 39, said she started the work out of her \"personal clashes\" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter. \"I sealed tight all the windows. I started every day by checking the air pollution index,\" Chai said. Millions of other people are also doing the same. While they stop there, Chai goes deeper. \"I don't want to live in this way. 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on.\" Over a year, she investigated polluted sites to find the sources of smog, visited the US and the UK to learn about their anti-pollution experiences, and interviewed officials, scientists and the general public. Chai's research reveals that the burning of coal and oil contributes to 60 percent of PM2.5 pollutants. She thus questions the country's energy consumption habits in the film. She then goes on to disclose loopholes   in car emissions regulations. The film also explains that businesses are pressured not to abide by  the laws because violating  them carries little or no cost, while making changes bumps up costs. The film also points at China's petroleum and steel industries as the biggest sources of air pollution. Cheng Chen, a 22-year-old student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, found the documentary \"very inspiring\". \"I used to think it's not my duty to deal with air pollution--I don't own a factory or a car,\" said Cheng. \"But Chai told me we share the same fate since we breathe the same air and there is a lot I can do.\" However, some people are annoyed by the film's description of their polluted hometowns, especially when it shows a banner from Xingtai in Hebei saying \"Congratulations to our city for no longer being ranked the last place among the country's 74 cities in terms of air quality\".  _ \"What's important is that Chai's work has raised public attention toward the structure of the energy industry,\" she said.   Meanwhile, experts remind moved viewers of the film's limitations. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is true? \n Options: (A) The documentary was made by Chai jing , who works in CCTV now. (B) The documentary dominated headlines and social websites soon after it was broadcast on TV. (C) Chai started making the documentary after she gave birth to a daughter. (D) Chai thinks that it is the burning of coal and oil that leads to air pollution in china. \n Asnwer: C",
