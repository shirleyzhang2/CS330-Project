You going need to search a long time to find scriptural basis in the NT for your assertion.  \n\nThe authorship of Hebrews is uncertain - Eusebius, the Greek historian and polemicist of Christianity (314 AD) had his doubts about Paul's authorship .  But we do know that it was written most likely in Rome - therefore it presents a christology that is a backwards look in time.\n\nScholars believe the Book of Hebrews - very polished and eloquent - was written for Jewish Christians.  Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity - which eventually did become a major tenet in Christianity's priesthood cult.",
