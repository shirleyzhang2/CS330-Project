        "You will receive a target race and two sentences. You need to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. If the second sentence is a stereotype of the target race, output 'stereotype'. If the second sentence is an anti-stereotype of the target race, output 'anti-stereotype'. If the second sentence is unrelated to the target race, output 'unrelated'."
