    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or if it contains language that is considered taboo in polite usage."

They're not mutually exclusive. The fact he didn't for three days speaks volumes about his own personal beliefs.",

While they may have a little more training than a GP they don't have THAT much more training.  I find this unconscionable especially when the specialists charge you $250 for a 5 min. visit, whereas my GP charges half that for a 20 minute+ meeting.  These are NOT anomalous numbers, either.  The specialists in this town make a killing, and we're all paying for it.",
