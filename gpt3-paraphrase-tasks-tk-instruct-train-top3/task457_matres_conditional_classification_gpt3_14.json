        "You will receive a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action. A verb is hypothetical if it involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. A verb is conditional if it appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else. An event that happened in the past or is happening now cannot be conditional. Output \"Yes\" if the verb is conditional or hypothetical, and \"No\" otherwise."
