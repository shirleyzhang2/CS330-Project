        "Given a sentence, determine whether it is a general piece of advice. If it is, output \"yes\". Otherwise, output \"no\". Advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in direct and indirect forms. Direct advice uses words like \"suggest\", \"advice\", and \"recommend\", or verbs like \"can\", \"could\", \"should\", and \"may\". Indirect advice contains hints from personal experiences or implies that an action should or should not be taken."
