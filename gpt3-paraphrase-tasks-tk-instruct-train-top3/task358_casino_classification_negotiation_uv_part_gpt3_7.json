    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances, output Yes if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output No. The uv-part strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy used to undermine the requirements of the opponent. For instance, suggesting that the opponent would not need more firewood since they already have the basic supplies or a suggestion that there might be a store near the campsite where the opponent can get the supplies instead."

I can do with 1 water or if you are in a giving mood then maybe I can have 2 waters? \ud83d\ude42' 'Looks like we both really need the food.  If you get 2 food I would need 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood. '\nUtterance: 'Since you will get all the fire would do you think I could have 2 foods and 2 waters.
