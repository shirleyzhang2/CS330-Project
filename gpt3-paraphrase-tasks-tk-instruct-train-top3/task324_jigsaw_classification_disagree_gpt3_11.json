        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You need to classify the comment as 'disagree' or 'agree'. A comment is classified as 'disagree' if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. A comment is classified as 'agree' if it is not likely to raise any of the abovementioned level of public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

        {
            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The topic of climate change conspiracy is controversial. This comment expresses the user's disbelief of climate change, which is against the general consensus. Thus, this comment is likely to raise public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

Justin Trudeau brought the Liberal Party back from 3rd place to  power and recruited a lot of bright,accomplished people albeit some with very little political experience especially of the go for the throat school of Rove in which many of the CPC members are steeped.\n\nTrudeau has degrees from  2  great universities, Mcgill and UBC and is widely read and traveled.\n\nThe leader of the opposition has a BA and few months training as an insurance salesman. Many CPC MP's  went directly into back room politics from high school or university.\n\n Thee is nothing wrong with any of his of course but to then blather on about Trudeau  not being up to the mark is comic considering the source.\n\nThere has probably never been as weak and undistinguished a cabinet  as Harpers and Scheers \"shadow cabinet\" is about the same.",

The author has ideas to change the present. The whole premise of this piece is about dealing with \"present\" issues.\nYou, and others, as he suggests, are just not listening, or do not want to listen.\nHe lists a few legitimate \"present\" concerns: \n\"slow implementation of recommendations made by the inquiry investigating the death of seven First Nations youth in Thunder Bay; and we\u2019ve seen the grieving family of Barbara Kentner, the First Nations victim in a racially motivated killing, forced to flee their homes because of threats made against their children at school.\"\nYour complete inability, or desire, to understand what he is saying suggests you come to the discussion with a mind already made up.\nThat is the problem.",
