I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought this product again. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, 1 is an incorrect answer."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

However, the fabric feels really cheap. Like it would not be breathable at all. Actually, it feels like the kind of polyester that would make me feel too hot. It's probably better as a regular wear polyester tank, but not so much for a workout tank. \n Rating: 3",
