    "Definition": [
        "You are given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail are events involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
