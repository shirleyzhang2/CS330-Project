Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. \\nAs for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. \\nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try",
