        "You are given a short poem. Your task is to predict if the kid who wrote it is in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from 1st grade to 6th grade will be considered as in elementary school, and anyone from 7th grade to 12th grade will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output, and no input can have both categories at the same time."
