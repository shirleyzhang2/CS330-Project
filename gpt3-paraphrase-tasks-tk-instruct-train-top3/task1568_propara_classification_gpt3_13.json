        "In this task, you are given a paragraph, an event and an entity. The event is part of the paragraph and it changes the state of the entity. Your task is to classify the state of the entity into three classes: 1) not exist: this means the entity doesn't exist in that state anymore. 2) unknown location: this means the entity exists in that state but location is unknown. 3) known location: this means the entity exists and location is known."
