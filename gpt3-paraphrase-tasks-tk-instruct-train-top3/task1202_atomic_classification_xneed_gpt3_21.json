    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether PersonX needs what is mentioned in the Tail before the Head or not, where \"need\" is a precondition for PersonX to achieve the event. For example, if the Head is \"PersonX gives PersonY gifts\", and the Tail is \"PersonX buys the presents\", then the answer would be \"Yes\" since PersonX needs to buy the presents before giving them as gifts. The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
