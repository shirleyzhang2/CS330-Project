        "In this task, you are given a short passage. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people(based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, abilities, etc.). An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into two classes: stereotype or anti-stereotype. If the passage is a stereotype, output 'stereotype'. If the passage is an anti-stereotype, output 'anti-stereotype'."
