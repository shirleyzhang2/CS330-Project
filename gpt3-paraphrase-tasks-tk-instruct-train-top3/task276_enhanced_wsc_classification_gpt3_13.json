        "You will be given two sentences. One of them is a paraphrase of the original sentence, with changes in one or more aspects. Your task is to decide what the difference is between the two sentences. The types of changes that can occur are explained below: Tense: The verbs in the sentence are changed in tense. Number: Plural nouns, verbs and pronouns are changed into single ones or the other way around. Voice: If the verbs are in active voice, they're changed to passive or the other way around. Adverb: The paraphrase has one adverb or more than the original sentence. Gender: The paraphrase differs from the original sentence in the gender of the names and pronouns. Synonym: Some words or phrases of the original sentence are replaced with synonym words or phrases. Changes in the names of people are also considered a synonym change. Classify your answers into Tense, Number, Voice, Adverb, Gender, and Synonym."
