            "input": "i wish i would of commented on this place right after i left it in february because you would have been able to read my frustrations and anger so much more. we first went in there and it was day time. mind you we went in there just to drop our items of and take a quick nap since we were coming in from san diego and had been driving. it was dark in there because the curtins were closed. when we walked in i was shocked to see that the room was pretty big. we took naps and were refreshed. we leave fast because we were there to go to a conference. we come back that night and realize there is a strip club next door. mind you, we were so tired we didnt realize this earlier. and its not that big of a deal... it was just awkward. we're parking the car and we pull up to a space that appears to have people in the car all on drugs. i mean they llooked way past drunk. there people looked like some crystal heads. we park somewhere else and it was just an awkward feeling. most of the people in parking lot seemed unfriendly and it appeared there were several tenants there. we get inside and turn on all lights and just kinda relax. we go in bathroom and realize the ceiling has a large bubble on it and its dripping water which is hitting the bathroom floor and also the bath tub. the bath tub has what appears to be black mold growing. the \\\"\"white\\\"\" towels had black faded out stains. not one towl appeared clean. the toilet had a pubic hair on it and a ring inside. so were all like, yikes! we sit on bed and then we pull back sheets and realize they dont feel crisp and clean. they didnt have stains or anything, but just the feel was odd. my friend closed the door and the old school air conditioner cover came off. i mean this place was like nothing i ever seen before. so we complained and the guy refused to give us a refund. the reason was because by this time it was 11:00 pm and we checked in around 3:00. we explained that the reason was because we came to drop off items and we shortly  left. he still didnt want to. eventually with attitude showed us another room. the bathroom was disgusting. we lifted toilet seat and it had dark pee drippings on it. we asked the man (i believe his name is mark or robert.. asian man) if he could clean it and he refused. im guessing because this is not in his job discription. i told jim to drop his attitude and know i am not trying to get over on him, but no one would want to pay for this. we ended up convincing him to give us our money back and around 1:00 am we left. i gave this one star because i had no other choice. i would never recommend this place to anyone unless you had no other choice in the entire world.\\n\\np.s... u get what u pay for here",

            "input": "My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and had lunch at Bahn Thai last week. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Just OK. It was also way overpriced. It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi.",
