Why aren't they guilty of conflict of interest like you claim Prozanski is for riding a bike? \nAnd do you have something against those who drive a Prius? What if it was a  Ford C-Max hybrid? Would you have the same belief it would be an \"oblivious\" liberal?  And what type of vehicles meet your criteria that the driver is not an oblivious liberal?  What vehicle type do people like you drive?\nI know that I for one, have issues with young cowboys driving lifted trucks with giant tires extending well beyond the wheel well, flying Confederate flags while spitting chewing tobacco, listening to country drinking songs and rolling coal.

The governor and the legislature have created chaos in the state by their alarmist B.S. . People are attacking each other right and left because they are so frustrated with what the upper administrative government is doing and not doing.....  State workers are actually being threatened and treated like dirt for doing their jobs ...................People it's not the state workers doing it. \nPeople who've never had to pay an income tax can't stand the idea of having to pay and they are the worst ones to scream,  and they ARE screaming......   I hear a certain talk radio show in the morning and people call in there and actually BELIEVE that they shouldn't EVER have to contribute by paying state taxes  but they want everything the state has to give them.

Local and state  laws force religious dissenters who don't want their product  in a homosexual ceremony that their genuine religious beliefs find disgusting and abhorrent, and against their beliefs but the Obama EEOC just ruled that Muslim Somali drivers who took jobs as delivery drivers can refuse to carry liquor    based on the very religious beliefs the States, and local laws deny the religious dissenters. \n\nSo one set of rules for Muslims and another for Christians here in freedom loving America founded by peoples seeking religious freedom?\n\nNo double standard here?",
