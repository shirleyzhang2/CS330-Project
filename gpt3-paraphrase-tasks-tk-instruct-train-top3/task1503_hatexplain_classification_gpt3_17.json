        "The input will be a tweet. The tweet can be classified as Hate Speech, Offensive, or Normal. Hate Speech and Offensive tweets target one specific community. Given such a tweet, you must output the community that is targeted in the tweet. The community will be one of nine values: 'African', 'Islam', 'Jewish', 'Women', 'Refugee', 'Arab', 'Caucasian', 'Hispanic', or 'Asian'. Output 'None' if the tweet does not target any community. A tweet can only target one community."
