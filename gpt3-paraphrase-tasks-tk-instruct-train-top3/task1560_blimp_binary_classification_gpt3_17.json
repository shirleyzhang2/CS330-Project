        "In this task, you will be shown an English sentence. You need to output 'good' if the sentence is a correct representation of an anaphor number agreement, or 'bad' if the sentence is an incorrect representation of an anaphor number agreement. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality."
