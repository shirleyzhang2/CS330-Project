            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",
            "output": "4",
            "explanation": "The passage talks about optical mice or mouse throughout which is a part of computer system. Thus, it is correctly classified to \"Computers & Internet\" "

            "input": "Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the\nprocess of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen\ngas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase\nshelf life and stabilize the original\npolyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to\nsaturated fat, which raises \"bad\" LDL cholesterol\nand can lead to clogged arteries and heart\ndisease. \\nUntil very recently, food labels were\nnot required to list trans fats, and this health\nrisk remained hidden to consumers. In early July,\nFDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon\nbegin identifying trans fat content in processed\nfoods.",

            "explanation": "Throughout the passage, food, clogged arteries and heart\ndisease are discussed in relation to Trans fats, which all are closely related to the topic \"Health\". Thus, passage is correctly classified."

He misleads the commanders and generals in the field to get his own agend passed.\\n4. He lies and misleads the United Nations.\\n5. He wiretapps innocent americans and expects to pass it off as anti-terrorism efforts.\\n6. He has started a huge 'political and religious' war against terrorists, and neglects to cover losses in the united states such as hunger, drugs, poverty, guns and hate crimes.\\n7. He is staunchly against gay and lesbian rights, which as they are americans should be affored the same rights and roles as everyone else.\\n8. He flaunts his power, even though he doesn't have a clue on how to use it.  His IQ is one of the lowest of any president in history; he hasn't written any of his own speeches, let alone a book about his policy and life.  In general his intelligence leaves quite a bit to be desired.\\n9. He doesn't seem to care about world policy; it is his way or the highway.\\n10. He has put our boarders at risk, even from the canadians.\\n11. He has severed ties to some of our oldest allies, simply because some of our allies think that he has gone to far in his push for world peace.\\n12. He is constantly trying to push his world agenda onto other conountries, and forcing democracy into their countries without their consent.\\n13. He doesn't feel that those who are not christian should have the same rights as those that are.\\n14. He doesn't feel that POW's are entitled to any basic civil liberties.\\n15. He doesn't aggree with the Geneva Convention, in fact he has wanted to rewrite it several times.\\n16. He wants to actually remove us from our seat at the UN, which would be catastrophic to the agency as we hold a founding seat.\\n17. He has invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and continously defends our rights there; whereas we should have no rights there as that is NOT our country or our protectorate, instead it is the soverign right of the iraqi people, not americans.\\n18. He neglects his duty as president and spends more than 1/2 his normal time and term on vacation or away from the white house.\\n19. He cuts funding to military bases, military outposts, military members and families; and then increases funding for anti terrorism funds with said cuts.\\n20. He cuts funding for military housing for families in need.\\n\\nThose are the top 20 reason why i believe he is a bad president.",
