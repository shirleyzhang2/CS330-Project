Sex is not \"making love,\" but I think that euphemism causes a lot of the confusion that people have in conflating love and sex.\n\nBiology is pretty clear about how our sex organs are to be used, for reproduction and/or satisfaction of our sex drives, best if they are performed with those whom we've promised to love for the rest of our lives.  All sexual perversions should be confessed, including those committed between husbands and wives.  I can live with confessing that; homosexuals should, as well.",
