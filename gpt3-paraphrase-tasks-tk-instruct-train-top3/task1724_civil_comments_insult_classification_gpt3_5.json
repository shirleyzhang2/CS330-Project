Mr. Trump has repeatedly \"rung the bell\", then done his best to \"unring\" it.  That's very hard to do.  \n\nBTW: You seem to equate throwing rocks at the police with actions such as suicide bombing:  Really?  \"Terrorism is classified as fourth-generation warfare and as a violent crime. In its broadest sense, is defined as the use of violence, or threatened use of violence, in order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological aim. In modern times, terrorism is considered a major threat to society and therefore illegal under anti-terrorism laws in most jurisdictions. It is also considered a war crime under the laws of war when used to target non-combatants, such as civilians, neutral military personnel, or enemy prisoners of war.[1]\"",

There would have been no wait lists in the Phoenix VA, McCains hometown VA, if they had been adequately funded to be able to hire more clerks as well as healthcare providers. Sanders got McCain to come on board as cosponsor of essentially the same bill just to get some of the recalcitrant  Republican senators on board. Why didn't McCain of all people know what was happening at the Phoenix VA do you suppose? Murkowski, Sullivan and Young endorsed the odious Trump even after he called Mexicans rapists and murderers, proposed a ban on all Muslims coming to America and then more recently the claim that a judge could not be trusted to preside over a fair trial because he was of Mexican heritage though born in America to parents who came here before Drumpf's parents did. Lisa is in a very difficult position made worse by her fealty to party over country.",
