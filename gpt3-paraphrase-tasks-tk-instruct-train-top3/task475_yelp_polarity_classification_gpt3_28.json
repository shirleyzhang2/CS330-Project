I enjoy the comfortable seats but service will be keeping me away. \\n\\nI have had cold popcorn delivered to me, and red wine when I ordered white. One time I ordered a bottle of wine and received an open bottle with wine missing. Bartenders are overwhelmed easily and the bar is often filthy when any guests are present. The quality of food isn't worthy of the experience. \\n\\nI don't expect much from this place anymore which is sad. They have so much potential if they would take their service seriously.",

            "input": "LATE NIGHT SUSHI AT ITS BEST (At least, from what I've tried so far)\\n\\nI usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in Vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. Not Oyshi!\\nThankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.\\n\\nThe All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. \\n\\nI think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.\\n\\nI do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.\\n\\nThe alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Dana is not a huge sushi fan, so she opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, she had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables. It was a fantastic deal!",
