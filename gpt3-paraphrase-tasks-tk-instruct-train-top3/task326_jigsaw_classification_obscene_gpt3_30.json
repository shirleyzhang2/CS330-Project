        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment would be considered obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is taboo in polite usage."
