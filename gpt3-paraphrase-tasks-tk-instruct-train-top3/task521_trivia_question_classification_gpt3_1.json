            "input": "In one work this author details the life of a tomb-maker who makes extra money by playing the organ at an insane asylum, while another of his novels sees Swartz give a refugee proper documentation only after he tells him his life story in the title Portuguese city. In addition to The Black Obelisk and The Night in Lisbon, he also wrote about Robert and Otto selling their auto workshop and visiting Patrice in a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium in his novel The Three Comrades, while the turbulent life of the German surgeon Ravic is told in The Arch of Triumph. Another of his novels, The Road Back, is thought to be a sequel to his most famous book, in which the patriotic teacher Kantorek convinces Paul Bumer and his friends to join the Germany Army during World War I. For 10 points, name this German author who wrote All Quiet on the Western Front.",

            "input": "In one election, this man attacked Helen Gahagan Douglas by calling her \"\"the pink lady. \"\" At the American National Exhibition in Moscow, this man engaged in the \"\"Kitchen Debate\"\" with Nikita Khrushchev. After losing a governor's race to Pat Brown, this politician erroneously said the press wouldn't have him to kick around anymore. In another election, this man defended his use of a slush fund with the \"\"Checkers\"\" speech. For 10 points, name this former Vice President under Eisenhower, who lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, but eventually was elected president in 1968.",

            "explanation": "The text is describing some events that took place in the past, and there's nothing relevant to literature, science or art involved, so the category is history."

            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke. Following World War II, this artist produced such collections as Mormon Villages and The Irish Countryman, and her report with her husband Paul Taylor led to her employment by Roy Stryker, who had hired Esther Bubley for similar reasons. Her work was used in an exhibit on Executive Order 9066, but she remains better known for a work whose title figure remained unknown for forty years until she identified herself as Florence Owens Thompson, a portrait produced as the result of her hiring by the Farm Security Administration. For ten points, identify this photographer who produced some of the most famous images of the Great Depression, including Migrant Mother.",
            "output": "Literature",
            "explanation": "Although an artist might contribute to literature, going further through text shows that the mentioned artist is a painter, so the correct label is fine arts."

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",
            "output": "History",
            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."

The growth of these structures are controlled by organelles called spitzenkorpers. These structures are made up of individual cells that are divided by septa. Yeasts are unicellular, and thus do not have these structures. For 10 points, name these branching filaments that collectively form the mycelium in fungi.",

One theory by this man, elaborated in his work Childhood and Society, posits that every child must choose between (*) trust and distrust and ego-identity and role confusion at various times.

The Gettier problem questions the traditional formulation that a statement's truth and its belief implies that it is this, while another philosopher discussed how this can be derived either through statements about \"relations of ideas\" or through \"matters of fact\" in Hume's fork. For 10 points, identify this concept defined as the intersection of what is true and believed, the theory of which is called epistemology.",
