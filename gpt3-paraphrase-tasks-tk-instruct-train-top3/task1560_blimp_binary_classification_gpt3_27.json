        "In this task, you will be given an English sentence. You need to output 'good' if the sentence is a valid representation of an anaphor number agreement, or 'bad' if it is not. A valid representation of an anaphor number agreement is a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality."
