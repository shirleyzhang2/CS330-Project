            "input": "Most historians argue, to the contrary, that throughout the interwar period, Germany remained mired in an economic slump that had begun with the collapse of peace and the first phase of trade globalization in 1914. In 1929, by almost every measure, Germany had not yet recovered the levels of prosperity it had enjoyed prior to 1914; in many sectors of the German economy, unemployment ran high straight through the 1920s. \n\nAlso, Germany's political system was (and is) parliamentary, which is to say that voters cast ballots for parties, not candidates. Hitler's party, the NSDAP, won 16% of the votes in the 1930 parliamentary election. In 1932, Hitler stood for election as German president, but was defeated by Paul von Hindenburg, the incumbent, who won 53% of the vote. Hitler got only 37%. The Communist candidate, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, came in third with 10%. The most Hitler's party got in a free election was 37.3% (July 1932). In January 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor, not elected.",

Mall jobs do not in the vast majority of cases, make homeowners.  Many renters use upto 80% of their income for housing due to high cost of rentals, driven by Airbnb and similar subrosa rental services and rail driven speculation.  The blended bus rail pass will likely be in the $120 to $165 range with the long haul busses,  $90-120 without, due to how badly lowballed and inept planning and execution has been on the Corrupt Rail System.  Due to all the new condos, railway hotels, high rises and housing developments from Corrupt Rail System TOD, to say nothing of all the new malls.... HECO does NOT have the extra capacity to power the Corrupt Rail System, so the incompetent HART has to build their own power plant!
