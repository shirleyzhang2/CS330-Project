            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

            "input": "Paragraph: As the criminal case moves toward possible trial this year, related pending lawsuits reflect a battle over blame. A look at where things stand: THE ALLEGATIONS  The Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System determined William Husel ordered excessive doses for nearly three dozen patients over several years, though it said the doses likely weren\u2019t what caused six of those deaths. Reviewers found that in many cases, the drugs were accessed by overriding a dispensing system. Husel was fired in December 2018, weeks after a concern was raised. Mount Carmel later said three patients died during those weeks after receiving excessive doses he ordered. ___ CRIMINAL CASE  Last June, Husel was charged with murder in 25 deaths and pleaded not guilty in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. He was charged only in cases involving 500 to 2,000 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl \u2013 doses so unusually large that prosecutors said it indicated an intent to snuff out lives. His initial lawyer said Husel was providing comfort care to dying patients, not trying to kill them. Husel\u2019s current lawyers in the criminal case \u2014 including Florida-based Jose Baez, who is known for successfully defending high-profile clients such as Casey Anthony and Aaron Hernandez \u2014 haven\u2019t said much publicly about his motives. Husel\u2019s lawyers in civil cases contend that he provided appropriate care and that Mount Carmel misled the public about what happened. Mount Carmel publicly apologized, tightened its drug policies, fired other employees and changed leadership but has stood by its investigation and subsequent decisions. \u201cThere is nothing more important to us than our patients\u2019 safety and their trust in us \u2014 and we will do everything in our power to continue to improve,\u201d it said in an emailed statement Tuesday. Trial for Husel, 44, is currently scheduled for June. _____ LOTS OF LAWSUITS  More than 30 lawsuits have been filed against Mount Carmel in the matter, and it has agreed to more than $13 million in related settlements so far. Husel and Mount Carmel unsuccessfully argued the remaining lawsuits should be put on hold until the criminal case is resolved. Husel also has filed lawsuits. One against Mount Carmel and its parent company, Michigan-based Trinity Health, alleges defamation. Another against Trinity and its insurer seeks to force them to cover costs of his defense in the criminal case, just as in civil cases against him. _____ FORMER COLLEAGUES  Authorities aren\u2019t prosecuting those who administered the drugs, though they have faced other fallout. Mount Carmel said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation. Ten of Husel\u2019s former colleagues recently sued Mount Carmel for defamation and, in some cases, wrongful termination. The group of mostly nurses decried a \u201c false narrative of an evil rogue doctor and his complicit staff\u201d and said the spread of that narrative damaged their lives and livelihoods regardless of whether they were fired. Three pharmacists and 25 nurses still face potential disciplinary action from their respective state boards and have administrative hearings scheduled in the coming months. Husel is in line for one, too, after the Ohio State Medical Board suspended his license. It hadn\u2019t previously disciplined him. ___ Follow Franko on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/kantele10.

            "input": "Paragraph: Cost wasn\u2019t mentioned, but given that this is light activity, we\u2019ll rate this N//A. Still, the story could have explicitly said that the activities that are highlighted in this study probably have no cost associated with them. The story notes that engaging in light activity for 30 minutes per day reduced relative risk of mortality during the study period by 12 percent. It also noted that engaging in moderate activity for 30 minutes per day reduced that risk by 39 percent. But what about the absolute risk reduction? As the NIH has noted, the benefits of physical activity far outweigh the risks. For that reason, we won\u2019t ding this story for not going into details regarding the risks associated with light physical activity. Nonetheless, it would have been nice to see the story mention that older adults may want to consult with a health professional to determine what types of activity they should (or should not) engage in. The story does briefly point out that this type of study can\u2019t prove cause and effect, though it quickly pivoted to a \u201chowever\u2026\u201d to weaken that point. A limitation that should have made it into the news story is that individuals weren\u2019t assigned a level of activity\u2013rather they presumably went about their usual activities for a week (just a week) and the device captured it. The authors then categorized individuals into three categories of increasing level of activity. The challenge is that people who are less active, may be that way for a reason. Maybe they are sick, or have other issues that make them less active. And that might have been a temporary problem. This helps readers understand why the study can\u2019t prove cause and effect. There\u2019s really no disease mongering here, though there is one note we\u2019d like to make that falls under this heading as well as anywhere. The story tells readers that increased physical activity is \u201clinked to a lower risk of death.\u201d Reader, we have bad news\u2026death is inevitable. It would be more accurate to note that physical activity reduced the relative risk of dying during a given timeframe (in this case, the three-year period of observation). No outside sources are cited in the story, nor does the story make clear who funded the research (addressing potential conflicts of interest). The study compared different levels of physical activity. As such, it was comparative. However, there are other important lifestyle habits that affect mortality (cigarette smoking or drinking alcohol, for instance), and it would be interesting to know how helpful light activity is compared to these other lifestyle modifications. The story does a good job of defining what light activity means, which is important for understanding how accessible it is. Bike riding is a moderate activity, for example, whereas \u201cstrolling around the neighborhood\u201d is a light activity. The story refers to national guidelines and some (nonspecific) \u201crecent analyses,\u201d noting that the \u201cnew study refutes that research.\u201d But is this the first study to show benefits like these from engaging in low-intensity daily activities? No. For example, this 2014 study published in Preventive Medicine examined \u201cexamine[d] the association between household physical activity and all-cause mortality in a cohort of older adults from Spain.\u201d The study relied on self-reporting from study participants, but found that \u2014 among other things \u2014 \u201cHousehold physical activity may have benefits for longer survival in older women.\u201d It would have been interesting to see the article look at how the new study compared to the 2014 study. Do the findings support each other? How do they differ? This sort of context would be valuable for readers. What does appear novel is the use of a device to assess activity\u2013versus recording what people report as their activity levels. This is borderline. The story maps very closely to the news release. However, the story appears to incorporate quotes from study author Andrea LaCroix that are not found in the news release. Claim: Want to Live Longer?

            "input": "Paragraph: \"When one thinks of the country\u2019s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street. During an appearance April 17 on NBC\u2019s \"\"Meet The Press,\"\" North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States. \"\"The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they\u2019re more powerful than the NRA,\"\" McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association. The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina\u2019s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations \u2014 and which McCrory was on national television to defend. \"\"They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue,\"\" McCrory said. The HRC is the country\u2019s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making. But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion? McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2. Measuring political power It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse. We don\u2019t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. \"\"Meet The Press\"\" host Chuck Todd didn\u2019t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory\u2019s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a \"\"ridiculous question\"\" and declined to answer. We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer. There are many ways to measure a group\u2019s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying. He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, \"\"cultural resonance\"\" and record of success or failure. Baumgartner said he believes McCrory\u2019s comparison is \"\" or substantially exaggerated.\"\" But let\u2019s look into the numbers to see if they back that up. Money Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation. Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what\u2019s known as outside spending \u2013 TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives. In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA\u2019s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC\u2019s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million). In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million). In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent. \"\"Cultural resonance\"\" How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces. And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top. Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA\u2019s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC\u2019s. Both groups have magazines. The HRC\u2019s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA\u2019s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million. As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC. The NRA also has a larger audience on social media \u2013 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC. We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC\u2019s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0. We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue. Even the HRC\u2019s best month didn\u2019t surpass the NRA\u2019s worst month. We also counted how often they\u2019re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine \u20131,408 results for \"\"National Rifle Association\"\" and 393 for \"\"Human Rights Campaign.\"\" Reputation and success Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make \u2013 on a group\u2019s \"\"ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers.\"\" And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn\u2019t quite stack up. \"\"I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success,\"\" he said. \"\"But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others.\"\" The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories \u2013 gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws \u2013 at the Supreme Court. The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law. Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act,\u00a0ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994. It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws. The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does. Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers \u2013 previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent \u2013 the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it. As for the HRC, it hasn\u2019t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT\u00a0status. And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It\u2019s undeniable that the HRC\u2019s influence there is growing. The group started ranking how \"\"LGBT friendly\"\" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did. And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn\u2019t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure. On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry. Our ruling McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is \"\"more powerful than the NRA.\"\" It\u2019s a strong claim, given the NRA\u2019s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it. That\u2019s not to say the HRC isn\u2019t powerful. It\u2019s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country\u2019s largest gay rights group. But it doesn\u2019t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn\u2019t even come close to the NRA\u2019s level of power.\" Claim: \"The Human Rights Campaign is \"\"more powerful than the NRA.\"",
