        "You will be given a post in English from an online platform. You need to determine if the post is hateful against immigrants and women. A post is considered hateful if it expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group. If a post is hateful but not towards immigrants and women, it should be labeled as non-hateful. Answer \"hateful\" or \"Non-hateful\". Note that the URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
