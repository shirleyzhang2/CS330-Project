Most of the strong AN leaders I have known were the products of Mt. Edgecumbe, St. Mary's or Chewalah. While they may complain about the damage it did to them, they returned intact, productive and employable. And it saved them years of rape, incest, secondary trauma and beatings. That in itself should be enough proof that abused children may do better in the long run if they are taken out of the  abuse at an early age. Point: Do those people in charge of these children realize that the abuse and neglect has long lasting effects? Its the adults who complain, not the children.",

There was a note on top from my boss, to come see him about this guy, as he was being released onto supervision in the next few days.  When I got into his office we went over several things in regards to this individual.  As I was leaving his office, he stopped me and said don\u2019t forget the rest of his files!  There were two more boxes full of more files.  This guy had been in and out of jail, on and off probation, and parole (which can have concurrent or consecutive times), had multiple cases, and even some federal time dating from the 80\u2019s to 2000\u2019s. Talk about a time accounting nightmare.  He wasn\u2019t the only one I saw like that either. I don\u2019t think anyone should be in prison more than they are supposed to, but it\u2019s a complicated mess and it\u2019s going to occasionally happen.  I also think much of this lays on the offender.",
