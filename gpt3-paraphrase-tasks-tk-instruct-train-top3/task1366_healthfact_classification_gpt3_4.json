            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

More than 16,500 cases have been reported across the region. Indonesian health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said the country had registered 337 new infections, also a new daily high, taking the total to 3,293. Health experts say Indonesia faces a surge in cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest country. Indonesia has brought in \u201clarge-scale social restrictions\u201d, but President Joko Widodo has resisted bringing in the type of tough lockdowns imposed by neighbours and only moved to allow areas like Jakarta, where there has been a spike in cases, more powers to tackle the crisis.

            "input": "Paragraph: \"It is perhaps the most polarizing word in the health care debate: rationing. Countless conservative opponents of the Democrat-backed health care reform plans have used the word. Their argument goes like this: You get government more involved in running health care, you set a goal of reducing costs, and it will inevitably mean rationing of medical services. It's not a long road from there to images of Grandma being denied a life-saving operation as a cost-saving measure. Everyone from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to Sen. Chuck Grassley has warned that people have reason to worry about rationing, while Democratic proponents of the plan have dismissed the claims as uninformed fearmongering. The term rationing has become so ubiquitous in the health care debate, we could've chosen to fact-check statements from any number of politicians as a way to talk about this issue. In a separate item, we looked at a claim about rationing from House Republican Leader John Boehner. In this item, we opted for one from Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, if only because he was so definitive about a subject with a lot of gray. \"\"Let me just say, A, there's no rationing in any of these bills, so we don't have to worry about that,\"\" Dean said on ABC's  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  on Aug. 9. Before we examine his specific claim, let's look at the criticisms that have led to charges of rationing. The critics have often focused on two areas of the health plan to back up their accusations. The first is a proposal to expand comparative effectiveness research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. Some opponents, however, claim the government would use findings from this research to ration care. We looked into this issue in detail and concluded that claim is    . Other opponents of the plan have pointed to the Obama administration's proposal for an Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC). The board would make annual recommendations for changing federal payments for various services covered by Medicare, as well as recommendations on ways to reform the Medicare delivery system. Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argues that price controls recommended by IMAC's unelected board amount to implicit rationing. Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a group that helps seniors get care under the federal program, doesn't agree. Stein is no fan of IMAC, but she said its goal is not to \"\"ration\"\" care but to seek out ways to improve the efficiency of Medicare services, not necessarily cut them. We note that while IMAC has been recommended by the Obama administration, it was not included in any of the House bills so far. It has been discussed as an option by the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Still, we think it's a little premature to suggest this is part of the health care reform plan. And we think claims that IMAC might lead to wholesale rationing are alarmist. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the IMAC proposal and concluded it would save the government $2 billion from 2016\u20132019. That doesn't sound to us like the CBO expects any kind of dramatic cuts in service. In fact, we think much of the rhetoric from opponents about how the Democrats' health plan would lead to wholesale rationing has been wildly distorted, fanning the flames of public fear that the health care plan would have the government setting dollar limits on how much could be spent in a year to care for a patient, or deciding that some groups of people \u2014 older or disabled people, for example \u2014 should not get care because it's too expensive for the common good. And so it's understandable that Dean would want to knock down these wild claims. But we think Dean goes too far when he says the bills have \"\"no rationing,\"\" because it ignores a hard reality of health care \u2014 there is rationing now and there would be rationing in the Democrats' plan too. \"\"This whole notion of rationing as it applies to a public option, I think, is really ridiculous,\"\" Stein said. \"\"It is what insurance is. Right now, Congress and any health care plan 'rations.' No health insurance I know pays for 'whatever it costs.'\"\" \"\"Everyone hates the word rationing,\"\" said   Katherine Baicker,   a health economics professor at Harvard University. \"\"From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything.\"\" And you can bet people who can't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition feel like there's already rationing. Ditto for those who can't afford health insurance. Proponents of the health reform plan \u2014 which seeks to provide basic coverage to everyone, regardless of whether they have a pre-existing condition \u2014 argue that it would clearly reduce that form of rationing. You could spend an unlimited amount on health care that would have some chance of helping people, Baicker said. But we have a limited amount of public resources. And so decisions have to be made about how to prioritize to allocate those resources. The idea, she said, is to provide adequate, basic health care in a public plan. Above that threshold, she said, people with more money could buy extra care. John Holahan, the director of the Urban Institute Health Policy Research Center, said he has not seen anything in any of the plans that will result in explicit rationing, but \"\"if you define rationing as 'people can't get everything they want,' it's true. But it's also true today.\"\" Interestingly, he said that Medicare is much less likely to deny a health service than a private insurer. \"\"That's the argument you hear people making (that the reform bills would lead to government rationing),\"\" Holahan said. \"\"But I think they have it backwards.\"\" Even Obama acknowledged the reality of health care rationing in a town hall on health care on Aug. 16: \"\"When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it,\"\" Obama said. \"\"Well, that's what's going on right now. It's just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies. \"\"Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world any time, regardless of expense. That would be a hard system to set up. So if you live in Maine, you know, we're going to fly you into California, put you up. I mean, you can see \u2014 and I'm not trying to make light of it \u2014 you can just see the difficulty. \"\"So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what's going on, et cetera. That's being done currently in the private marketplace. All we're trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren't discriminating against people because they're already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending.\"\" In other words, rationing is just a fact of life in a world with limited resources. Or as Cato's Cannon puts it: \"\"Asking if there will be rationing under the Obama plan is like asking if there will be gravity. It is ubiquitous and unavoidable.\"\" We realize some may read our ruling and conclude that we believe the Obama plan will mean more drastic rationing. But we think it's more accurate to say the bill seeks a more rational way to ration. Whether it can succeed is a topic for legitimate debate. The Democrats' health care plan calls for a health care exchange that will be a vigorous marketplace of companies offering different plans that will compete for customers by offering more or less coverage. But each of those choices about coverage \u2014 a lower or higher cap on out-of-pocket expenses, perhaps, or more or less generous coverage for doctor visits \u2014 are rationing. And the same goes for three-fourths of Americans who would probably keep their current employer-sponsored health insurance. Those plans too have limits and caps \u2014 and rationing. We rule Dean's statement .\" Claim: There's no rationing in any of these bills.",

            "input": "Paragraph: U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross is expected in July to decide whether to halt more than 160 active lawsuits brought by state attorneys general, cities and counties against opioid manufacturer Insys Therapeutics Inc. When it filed for Chapter 11 protection in Delaware earlier this month, Insys requested the cases be paused. A bankruptcy filing would normally halt active litigation immediately, giving a company such as Insys time to reorganize and preserve money that would otherwise be spent fighting the cases. But a longstanding exception in U.S. bankruptcy law can keep the lawsuits alive if they are enforcing government officials\u2019 \u201cpolice or regulatory power.\u201d The exception holds that government actions seeking to enforce laws related to matters such as public health and safety are not automatically stopped by a company\u2019s bankruptcy filing as other lawsuits are. State and local officials are suing Insys and other drugmakers in an attempt to address harm from an opioid crisis that has killed nearly 400,000 people between 1999 and 2017. More than half these deaths resulted from prescription painkillers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2EgfT0n  \u201cCriminal enterprises \u2026 should not be permitted to shield themselves from the consequences of their misconduct by running to bankruptcy court and obtaining the equivalent of a stay that allows them to evade justice,\u201d said Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh in a Tuesday legal filing opposing Insys\u2019s request to halt lawsuits. The opioid crisis \u201cis a national public health emergency,\u201d they said in the filing, which other state attorneys general supported, including those in New York, New Jersey and Arizona. \u201cThe interests of the public therefore are served by allowing these police powers actions of the states to continue unfettered by the injunctions that Insys seeks.\u201d  A spokesman for Insys, which faces trials in Maryland and Minnesota beginning in August, declined to comment beyond the company\u2019s court filings. Insys already had reached a $225 million settlement before filing for bankruptcy with the U.S. Justice Department, admitting to illegal conduct in resolving claims that it bribed doctors to write prescriptions, including medically unnecessary ones, for a fentanyl spray called Subsys designed to treat cancer pain. The Chandler, Arizona-based company still faces, overall, more than 1,000 lawsuits raising similar allegations of deception and fraud in marketing its opioids. The misconduct occurred under a prior management team that has since \u201centirely turned over\u201d and Insys is now committed to lawful marketing practices, the company said in court papers. Insys contends in bankruptcy-court filings that Judge Gross should halt the lawsuits against it regardless of any exceptions, lest the company drain limited financial resources fighting cases on multiple fronts. Allowing the cases to continue would leave less money for creditors, including the very government officials seeking to hold it to account, Insys contends, adding that its request is not an attempt to escape liability. It had less than $40 million in the bank when filing for bankruptcy and predicts spending up to $9 million through December to continue fighting lawsuits, according to court papers. The judge\u2019s ruling is expected to influence whether another opioid manufacturer facing 2,000 lawsuits - OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP - decides to file for bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter and legal experts. A Purdue spokesman declined to comment. A ruling allowing the Insys litigation to proceed could discourage Purdue from seeking bankruptcy protection, while pausing the cases might signal that Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings are a viable way to halt lawsuits and take advantage of breathing room to reach a broader settlement with plaintiffs, according to the person familiar with the matter and several legal experts. Insys lawyers are attempting to persuade government officials to agree to voluntarily halt their cases, according to a bankruptcy-court filing. Insys is nearing a deal that would effectively halt some of those legal claims against the drugmaker that are consolidated in an Ohio federal court, said Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for plaintiffs in the opioid litigation. An Insys spokesman declined to comment on the potential agreement. Insys has some legal precedent backing its approach. In 2017, a bankruptcy judge sided with Takata Corp when temporarily halting lawsuits brought by Hawaii, New Mexico and the U.S. Virgin Islands against the Japanese supplier of automobile airbags that exploded, finding that allowing the litigation to continue threatened the company\u2019s reorganization. That would have harmed creditors, including those seeking to hold Takata accountable for widespread deaths and injuries, the judge ruled. The ruling allowed Takata to focus on completing a sale to a rival, creating a combined company called Joyson Safety Systems. A Joyson representative declined to comment. The Minnesota and Maryland attorneys general argued in their legal filing on Tuesday that Insys has not demonstrated the kind of exceptional circumstances present in the Takata case - an unprecedented automotive recall - that warranted halting government lawsuits. While the outcome in the Insys case is not critical for opioid manufacturers with stronger balance sheets that face lawsuits, such as Johnson & Johnson, it holds significance for the likes of OxyContin maker Purdue, according to several legal experts. In March, Reuters reported that Purdue was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection to address lawsuits alleging it pushed prescription painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks, according to people familiar with the matter. Purdue\u2019s CEO later confirmed the company was considering a bankruptcy filing. The company has denied allegations it contributed to the opioid crisis, pointing to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving labels on its drugs carrying warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Claim: Fate of opioid litigation hinges on government 'police power'.",
