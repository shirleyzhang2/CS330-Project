        "You will receive a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to output \"Yes\" if the verb is conditional or hypothetical, and \"No\" otherwise. A verb is hypothetical if it involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. A verb is conditional if it appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else."
