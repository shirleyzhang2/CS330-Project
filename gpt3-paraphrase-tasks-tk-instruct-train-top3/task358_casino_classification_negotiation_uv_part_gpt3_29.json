    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). You need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output 'No'. uv-part is a selfish negotiation strategy used to undermine the requirements of the opponent. For example, suggesting that the opponent would not need more firewood since they already have the basic supplies or a suggestion that there might be a store near the campsite where the opponent can get the supplies instead."

I can do with 1 water or if you are in a giving mood then maybe I can have 2 waters? \ud83d\ude42' 'Looks like we both really need the food.  If you get 2 food I would need 1 food, 2 water and 3 firewood. '\nUtterance: 'Since you will get all the fire would do you think I could have 2 foods and 2 waters. You would get 1 food, 1 water, and 3 firewood. \ud83d\ude42 You seem like you are a great outdoor person that I would think you would be able to catch some fish to cook with the firewood. \ud83d\ude42'",
