Kenneth Tate worked for a private security firm when President Obama visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on September 16. He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in an exclusive television interview that he stuck to his assigned duties and tried to take photos after he was done escorting President Obama. Members of Congress were upset when the media reported last month that Tate had a .40-caliber handgun while in an elevator with the President. That report, coupled with news of an incident in which a man jumped a fence and made it into the White House, led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson.Fired security guard tells CNN he stuck to his assigned dutiesKenneth Tate only went to take pictures when the detail was over, he saysFederal official says CDC asked for Tate to be reassignedTate says he carried a handgun that he was given, never took photos of President on elevator \n Questions:Tate said he was supposed to take the President to two different floors of one of the _ buildings.
