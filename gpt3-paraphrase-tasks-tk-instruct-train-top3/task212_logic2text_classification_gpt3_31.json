    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given commands (in terms of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table. Your job is to classify the command into one of these seven categories: (1) majority, (2) unique, (3) superlative, (4) count, (5) comparative, (6) aggregation, and (7) ordinal. For each category, you are given a definition of what the category entails. For example, under the category of majority, it states that the command is describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows. In addition, there is a list of logical operators that are given to help you understand the commands. These logical operators include functions such as 'count', 'only', 'hop', 'and', 'max/min/avg/sum', 'nth_max/nth_min', 'argmax/argmin', 'nth_argmax/nth_argmin', 'eq/not_eq', 'round_eq', 'greater/less', 'diff', 'filter_eq/ filter_not_eq', 'filter_greater/filter_less', 'filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq', 'filter_all', 'all_eq/not_eq', 'all_greater/less', 'all_greater_eq/less_eq', 'most_eq/not_eq', 'most_greater/less', 'most_greater_eq/less_eq'. Based on the information given, your task is to output the correct category for the given command."

            "explanation": "The most_greater_eq command indicates that we need to select some majority rows, but label is 'count' which is not right."

            "output": "ordinal",
            "explanation": "The less command indicates the comparision between rows, hence, 'comparative' category is right, but the label is 'ordinal' which is wrong."
