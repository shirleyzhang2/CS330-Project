The odds of there being a \u201cgay gene\u201d are practically zero, likely there is no single factor that determines whether a person will be hetero or homosexual. Your silly assertion that people who don\u2019t believe homosexuality is a choice must believe in some here-to-for undiscovered \u201cgay gene\u201d is a classic straw man. As far as your god hypothesis goes there is as much evidence to support your belief in a supernatural being as there is santa clause the tooth fairy and the flying spaghetti monster. Im absolutely fed up with you wanna be iron age goat herders misrepresenting the scientific method. We tried it you way and we got the Dark Ages as a result.
