    "Definition": [
        "You will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are described by short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head includes an event or an action in the Tail. This happens when the Tail denotes a step within the larger head event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
