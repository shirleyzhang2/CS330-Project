            "input": "Review: Arrived broken. Manufacturer defect. Two of the legs of the base were not completely formed, so there was no way to insert the casters. I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

The mesh over the face is very fine but seems strong as well. The mesh on the ears is soft, but the holes are apparently too big for the tiny bugs. I came home from work today to find my horse frantically shaking his head. I removed the mask and found it full of gnats. My horse's face and poll were bloody. There were also blood spots on the mesh. The pictures I posted are of the onside of the mask. The white fleece liner is full of gnats, and the inside tip of the ear was crammed with them and dried blood from my horse's ear. \n Category: home_improvement",
