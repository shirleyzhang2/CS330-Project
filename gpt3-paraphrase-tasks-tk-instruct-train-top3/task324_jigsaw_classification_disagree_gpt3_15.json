            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

Brown is not even in power and has been caught in at least two lies, with one being the repeal of the sexual education reforms. He is trying to be everything to everyone (e.g., progressive and socially conservative), which does not make a good leader. Sadly, I trust Wynne more than I trust him. As for Horwath, she is incompetent, which was abundantly clear during the last election. If she is the best that the NDP can do, then the party will never form a government.",
