        "In this task, you will be given a sentence, and you will need to determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Your task is to classify the sentence into 'overruling' or 'non-overruling'."
