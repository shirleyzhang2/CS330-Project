        "Given a public comment from online platforms, you are expected to output 'disagree' if the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, or 'agree' if the comment is not likely to raise such level of public disagreement. Disagree means that the comment is classified as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Agree means that the comment is classified as agree if it is not likely to raise such level of public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

No one is better at spending other people's money than smug leftwing idealists in the Federal Liberals.  Trudeau is a naive idealist who grew up with a silver spoon completely disconnected from the economic realities facing most Canadian families. The Federal Liberals ignorantly believe they are better at spending taxpayer money than the people who actually earn it, they support big government, waste, and leftwing social experiments that waste money and yield nothing in return. Sunny ways, because it's 2016, #whatwouldJustindo, good for you Canada! And the government will run exclusively on \"green\" energy by 2025, because wind and solar have done wonders for Ontario... good for you Toronto, you deserve each other.",
