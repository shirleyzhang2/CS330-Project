These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

He has no fear and will swim out as far as he can go. The wrist links keep our hands free and I like how the adult wrist link comes off quickly if I need it to, while the toddler end is tougher to take off. These are very sturdy, don't get tangled up, and with the two lengths they are be exactly what I needed no matter the situation. The whistles might be good for an older child, but needless to say, with a two year old, I threw the whistles away. They are LOUD. \n Polarity: positive",
