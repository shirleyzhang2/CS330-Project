    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>, you have to determine whether the Head is used for the Tail or not. The usage describes everyday affordances or uses of objects and includes both typical and atypical uses. For example, a popcorn bucket can typically be used to hold popcorn, but it could also serve as a hat in atypical situations. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
