        "In this task, you will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. You will need to classify the questions as \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts taken from the context into a summary. Abstractive questions require you to paraphrase the context using new sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, usually yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

This process is based on the following heuristic:\n\nwe consider mentions spans in $S_q$ exactly matching an element of $C_q \\cup \\lbrace s\\rbrace $ . Admittedly, this is a rather simple strategy which may suffer from low recall.\n\nwe use predictions from a coreference resolution system to add mentions of elements in $C_q \\cup \\lbrace s\\rbrace $ beyond exact matching (including both noun phrases and anaphoric pronouns). In particular, we use the end-to-end coreference resolution by BIBREF16 .\n\nwe discard mentions which are ambiguously resolved to multiple coreference chains; this may sacrifice recall, but avoids propagating ambiguity. \n Question: How did they detect entity mentions?",
