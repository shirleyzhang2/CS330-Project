Tian Tian, the UK's only female giant panda, has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as August. However Edinburgh Zoo, where the pandas live, have warned people 'not to get too excited' as the process is 'extremely complex'. Moreover, on the two previous occasions keepers inseminated Tian Tian - whose name means 'Sweetie' - she has failed to produce a panda cub. She was artificially inseminated again in March this year, but keepers at the zoo say implantation - when a fertilised egg attaches to the uterus - has not yet occurred.Tian Tian has conceived and could give birth to a cub as early as AugustShe has been inseminated twice before but so far failed to produce a cubTian Tian and Yang Guang arrived in 2011 from China to great fanfareOn loan at \u00a3600k a year, became first giant pandas to live in UK for 17 years \n Questions:Under the terms of the agreement any cubs will return to _ at the age of two, the age at which they would normally leave their mother in the wild.

Lofty praise from one of football's greatest managers and fond memories in Old Trafford's dressing room may even be of some comfort to Rafael, whose move to France is, conservatively speaking, still a work in progress. It is unfair to say the step down from Manchester United to Ligue 1 hasn't worked out quite the way the defender had hoped. It has been positive. Some things never change; he's still got the most enthusiastic, beaming smile in any footballer's mugshot. But he needs a little more time to show Lyon supporters exactly what he's about and to find a position he can cement as his own.Lyon take on Valencia in Champions League at the Mestalla on WednesdayGary Neville is taking charge of his first game as new Valencia managerRafael replaced Neville in Manchester United team after he retired in 2011The Brazilian right back left United in the summer and joined Lyon \n Questions:The full back only managed to stay on the field for 30 minutes in _'s 0-0 draw with Nantes at the start of this month after picking up an early booking, and is still susceptible to blunders when back-passing.

Bassett was then chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, an agency set up in 2005 to regulate state crime labs after a series of embarrassing scandals. The first matter on its plate involved the 2004 execution of Cameron Todd Willingham, whose murder conviction rested largely on testimony that many arson experts now call outdated and incorrect. Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said. But then they started asking about Willingham, questioning whether the commission's review of the evidence in his case was beyond its legal powers.The former chairman of a state commission criticizes Gov. Rick PerryBassett says the case is a window into Rick Perry's leadershipPerry signed off on Cameron Todd Willingham's execution in 2004Arson experts say conviction was partly based on \"junk science\" \n Questions:Perry's campaign dismissed _'s accusations Wednesday, repeating the governor's characterization of Willingham as a \"monster\" who had sent his three young daughters to a fiery death.
