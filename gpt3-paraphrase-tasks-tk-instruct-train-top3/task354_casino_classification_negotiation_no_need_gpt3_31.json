    "Definition": [
        "The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output No. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, such as suggesting that they have ample water to spare. no-need can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
