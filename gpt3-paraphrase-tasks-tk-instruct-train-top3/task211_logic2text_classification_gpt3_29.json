        "In this task, you are given commands in terms of logical operations and a natural interpretation of the given command. Your task is to generate a label \"yes\" if the interpretation is appropriate for the command, otherwise generate label \"no\". The commands are given in terms of logical operations, and it is your job to determine if the natural interpretation of the given command is appropriate. If it is, output \"yes\", if not, output \"no\"."
