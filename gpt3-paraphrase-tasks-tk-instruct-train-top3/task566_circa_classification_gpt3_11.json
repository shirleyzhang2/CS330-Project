The first sentence provided tells us that the person likes to visit historical places. Sentence 2 is something related to rain. Both the sentences do not give the same meaning.

            "explanation": "In sentence 1, someone said that he is working on it, the sentence 2 also has the same meaning, so the output should be a Yes, as they both have the same meaning. But the machine interpreted it as No which is irrelevant."
