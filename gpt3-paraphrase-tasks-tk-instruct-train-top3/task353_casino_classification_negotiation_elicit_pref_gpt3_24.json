    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). The input is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages, based on their individual preferences and requirements. Output Yes if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, otherwise output No. elicit-pref is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

            "input": "Context: 'What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.' 'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "The primary utterance does not try to elicit information on the preference order of the participant. So this is correct."

            "output": "Yes",

' 'I understand that, but walking away with the most food and the most water would essentially leave me for dead lol. Do you prefer water or food?
