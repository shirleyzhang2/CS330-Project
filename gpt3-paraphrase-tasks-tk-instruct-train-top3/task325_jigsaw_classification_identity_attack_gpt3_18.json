The do-gooders can control the diets because of the power of the State to 'help'  the ignorant, misguided and poor to do what is 'best' for them.  Unfortunately, as a recent Mayor in New York City demonstrated with the size of sodas which could be sold, the 'do-gooders' want to direct and control the lives of everyone because they know what is 'best'.  The poor have no  'right' to have the taxpayers pay for whatever they want, but the do-gooders have no right to control all their choices, either.  Next thing you would have them requiring SNAP to only pay for vegan or organic food.",
