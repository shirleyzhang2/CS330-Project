    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If neither COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM."
