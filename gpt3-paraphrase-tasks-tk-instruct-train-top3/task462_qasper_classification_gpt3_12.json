    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. You will need to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from the context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. A Yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no."

On the other hand, for the factual accounts, we use a list with another 32 Twitter accounts from BIBREF19 that are considered trustworthy by independent third parties. \n Question: How did they obtain the dataset?",

The number of reviews in this movie corpus is 20,244 and the average number of words in reviews is 39. Each of these reviews has a star-rating score which is indicative of sentiment. These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive. We have randomly selected 7,020 negative and 7,020 positive reviews and processed only them. \n Question: What details are given about the movie domain dataset?",

Recent work BIBREF25 has shown that the automatic evaluation metrics borrowed from machine translation such as BLEU score BIBREF26 tend to align poorly with human judgement.
