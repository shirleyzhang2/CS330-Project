As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",
            "output": "NEG",
            "explanation": "As these reviews are written by people, they may have typos and grammatical issues. Here the word \"boring\" is missplled, but it is still obvious that the review is a negative one."

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "\"She loves me!  I can tell that through her screaming.\" . Very funny, I love the ol' classic screwball comedies where everyone is screaming hysterically, running madly and falling all over each other.    Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe, played with psychotic brilliance by John Barrymore, is a hyperactive megalomaniac stage director who after discovering Carole Lombard and making her into a gigantic star smothers her with his controlling nature until she finally has enough and leaves for Hollywood.    After she leaves he has nothing but flops until he's in danger of loosing his theater, so in one desperate last ditch effort he tries to get Lombard back.    How neither Howard Hawks nor John Barrymore got an Oscar nomination for this movie is a mystery to me.    D: Howard Hawks (RIO BRAVO, BRINGING UP BABY)    Oscar 'O.J.' Jaffe - John Barrymore (GRAND HOTEL, DINER AT EIGHT)  Lily Garland - Carole Lombard (MY MAN GODFREY, TO BE OR NOT TO BE)  Oliver Webb - Walter Connolly (IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, LIBELED LADY)  Owen O'Malley - Roscoe Karns (THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT)  Max Jacobs - Charles Lane (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, ARSENIC AND OLD LACE)  Mathew J. Clark - Etienne Girardot (THE KENNEL MURDER CASE, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME '39)",

The sessions just goes through the motions.  They don't emphasize the importance of form and breathing through out each session which is really needed for any skill level.  The transitions are way too fast.  Maybe I am spoiled by having such a great Pilates teacher but this DVD is a waste of money!",
