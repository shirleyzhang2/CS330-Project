    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. You must classify the type of irony the tweet has, and label it as \"polarity,\" \"situational,\" or \"other.\" Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Other kinds of irony are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
