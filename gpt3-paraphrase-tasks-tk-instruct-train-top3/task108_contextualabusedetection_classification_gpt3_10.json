        "Read the given text and output \"yes\" if it has abusive content, as defined below. Otherwise, output \"no\". We consider the content to be abusive if it contains any of the following instances: 1. Identity Directed Abuse: Content which contains a negative statement made against an identity. An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation. 2. Affiliation Directed Abuse: Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors). 3. Person Directed Abuse: Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language. 4. Counter Speech: Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others."
