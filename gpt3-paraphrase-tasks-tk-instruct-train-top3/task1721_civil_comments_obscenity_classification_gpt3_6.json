Why don't we make this a movie friendly state and bring the movie making to Alaska, the movie incentives. Hell it takes money to make money, but instead they want to take away old people's money, how retarded it that? LEAVE old people's money ALONE!!! they earned it and worked hard for it. THEY DESERVE IT. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT THEIR GOLDEN YEARS?\n want to cut this and CUT that out and want Alaska to be primitive. This Kink river bridge to make from the port of Anchorage to the valley, they been talking about that since I was knee high to a grasshopper. Only good thing about that, they will win the Guinness Book of World records for pooping and not getting off the pot, yeah just pooping words.. Just so tired of these Legislators, doing stupid.",

Somehow they convince their voters that everything is the fault of Obama and the Democrats.  So they put them in power and they find out that nothing changes.  They use their ignorant voters to get them into office and then desert them.   I laugh every night watching the nightly news where the GOP is doing all in their power to stop Trump, the guy they created in the first place.  Now they are going to lose the presidency, the Senate and the House.  Could not happen to a nicer group of lying scumbags.",
