        "Given a post from an online platform, your task is to determine whether the post is hateful towards immigrants and women. A hateful post expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group. If a post is hateful but not towards immigrants and women, it should be labeled as non-hateful. Your response should be either \"hateful\" or \"Non-hateful\". Note that the URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
