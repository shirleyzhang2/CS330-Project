Yes, I read the instructions of not using around the eye area and I was careful to adhere to that. I saw no results whatsoever on my face after using this product. I threw this product in the trash after using it for 10 days. I initially read the Amazon reviews and made my purchase with hopes but, nope, this product didn\u2019t deliver any improvement for me whatsoever. Won\u2019t be buying again. \n Summary: Basket and rack OK; only received one silicone mitt",
