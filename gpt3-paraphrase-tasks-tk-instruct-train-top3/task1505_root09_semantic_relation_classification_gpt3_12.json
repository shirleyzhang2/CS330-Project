    "Definition": [
        "For a given pair of words, X and Y, output the type of relationship between them. The possible types of relations are 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM."
