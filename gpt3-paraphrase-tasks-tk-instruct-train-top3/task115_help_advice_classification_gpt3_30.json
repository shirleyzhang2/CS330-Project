        "You will be given a sentence. If the sentence is a general piece of advice, output \"yes\". Otherwise, output \"no\". Advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in various forms, such as Direct and Indirect advice. (1) Direct advice is explicit and uses words or questions that suggest a certain action should be taken. (2) Indirect advice is more subtle and implies that a certain action should or should not be taken, often based on personal experiences."
