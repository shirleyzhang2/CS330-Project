Many say it is racist, xenophobic, bigoted and Islamophobic to want to ban the full-face veil. In that case Chancellor Angela Merkel is a racist, xenophobic, bigoted, Islamophobic leader of Germany notwithstanding the fact Germany has been the most generous country on earth, or at least the most generous country in the western world, in assisting millions of migrants and refugees in recent years.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel stated recently that the full-face veil is incompatible with German values and against integration and should be banned.\n.\n\nI notice my Facebook-feed is full of people who are just itching to condemn people as racists, bigots, Islamophobes, etc, for the slightest deviation from, shall we say (for want of a better term), extreme political correctness.",
