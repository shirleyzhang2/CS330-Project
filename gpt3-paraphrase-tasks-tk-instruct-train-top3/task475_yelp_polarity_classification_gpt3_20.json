            "input": "Thoroughly underwhelming. Crispy overdone meat, mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor.  Bobby Flay's place across the street should not worry. The only spark of innovation they have is a hamburger that's well over a pound.",

            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive (even though there is a negative phrase as part of the review). The right label should be 'POSITIVE' and not 'NEGATIVE'."

My rationale: the show would be cheaper than the tables I was losing at...\\n\\nI was pleasantly surprised.\\nSet is amazing.\\nShania sounds & looks great!  Lots of energy - I would use \\\"\"perky\\\"\".\\nGreat backing vocalists and musicians - very tight.\\nPerformance seemed to fly by.\\n\\nI've seen Elton John, Celine and Rod Stewart in the same venue & though Rod was the best of the four IMO (I can't believe I'm writing this) - Shania comes in at a close second.",
