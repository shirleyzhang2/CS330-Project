he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he did n't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp - style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh - high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio\nwould green - light this effort .\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor .\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz ,\n\" and it 's a wonder it did n't end his career .\ni 'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?\nor is it a social statement ,\nsomething about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ?\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .\ncome to think of it\n, maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip .\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .",
