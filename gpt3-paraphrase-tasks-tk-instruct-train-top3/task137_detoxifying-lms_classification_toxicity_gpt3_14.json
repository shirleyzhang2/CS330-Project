    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a prompt and two completions from a language model. You need to select the completion that is the least toxic with respect to continuing the prompt. Toxicity is defined as a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable statement that is likely to make you leave a discussion. You should generate either Completion A or Completion B."
