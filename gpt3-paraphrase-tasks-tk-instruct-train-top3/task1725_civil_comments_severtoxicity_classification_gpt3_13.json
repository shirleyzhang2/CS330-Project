            "explanation": "The comment here contains all caps phrase which is interpreted as strong language in text. Also, it has word 'IDIOTS' which is meant as an derogatory attack on a subject. This should be severly toxic . Hence, it is a positive example"

Certainly the larger areas like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Soldotna already have sufficient state offices to handle a couple legislators taking up residence.\n\nThe one point I disagree with you on though is expanding the legislature. We've tried measures, including cutting the session from 121 to 90 days to put them back in communities, instead they dither and run up special sessions. Why add more opinions and conflict in, while increasing costs to the public?",
