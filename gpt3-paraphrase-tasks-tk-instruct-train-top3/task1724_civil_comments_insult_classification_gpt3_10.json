Each member should have been given a jail sentence, because each is individually guilty of fraud.  Siting at home with an ankle bracelet on is not punishment, it's a vacation.  Crime will continue to rise when we have a justice system that hands out plea bargains and ankle bracelets instead of mandatory jail time.",

So Ellis getting 3 months for killing a person is obscene when this dude gets 15 years for 8600 dollars worth of fraud.  A human life is at least a thousand more times as valuable as $8600.  So a thousand times 15 years is 15,000 years.  That would be a sentence more appropriate for Ellis.  3 months is a freakin' joke.",
