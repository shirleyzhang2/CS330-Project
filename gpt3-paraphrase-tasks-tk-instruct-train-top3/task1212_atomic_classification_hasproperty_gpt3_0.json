        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants.

You have to determine whether the Head can be characterized by being or having the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
