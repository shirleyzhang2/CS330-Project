        "You will be given a short poem written by a kid. You will need to predict if the kid is currently attending elementary school or high school. Grades 1st through 6th will be considered as elementary school and grades 7th through 12th will be considered as high school. There are only two possible outputs for this task: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output and no input will have outputs for both categories."
