Being capable of something includes general capabilities, such as a human is capable of thinking and reasoning or drinking coffee. It also includes specialized capabilities such as a surgeon is capable of operating on a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
