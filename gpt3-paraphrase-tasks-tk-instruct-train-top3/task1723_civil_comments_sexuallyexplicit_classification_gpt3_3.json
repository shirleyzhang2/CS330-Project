I'm sure there would be plenty of non-profit organizations that would provide the pills for little or no cost for women who cannot afford them. Deregulation is the only option that both empowers women to make their own contraceptive choices and affirms religious liberty.  Instead, one silly regulation leads to a constitutional crisis.
