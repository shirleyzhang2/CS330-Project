I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

I don't know if the couscous was stale or had simply absorbed a strange, chemical odor from the plastic bottle, but whatever the reason, the taste of the cooked product was bad. After opening the bottle and immediately noticing the smell, I was hesitant to actually cook it, but I did, hoping the smell would dissipate. It did not.

The controllers register a constant input. From where? Who knows. It happens with both controllers. I even took them apart and removed all the buttons to try to isolate the problem in case something was making contact. Even when nothing is touching the board, it has the same problem.
