Both SB21 and ACES were pushed by the cabal of Republican legislators to create an unbalanced contract.  Simply, Alaska's royalty should be no less than the profit gained by the oil producer.  Anything less is a give-away.  Now it is not only a give-away, but an insane result of paying the oil companies to \"take without compensation\" oil and gas that is first owned by Alaska.  As it stands, it is a criminal theft of Alaska's resource property.  The Alaska legislature must set right the situation (an undesirable situation): otherwise, \"by the time a problem becomes patently obvious, it may be almost too late to remedy it.\"  If not remedied in this session then the immediate solution is to REMEMBER THIS IN NOVEMBER.",
