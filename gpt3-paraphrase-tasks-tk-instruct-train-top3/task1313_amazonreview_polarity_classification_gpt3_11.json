I am very disappointed. \n Polarity: negative",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

You really have to force the cards in for some of the slots. I was really hoping I could replace my beat up wallet with this, but it's nothing like I was hoping and I'll probably just toss it out and keep using my old wallet.
