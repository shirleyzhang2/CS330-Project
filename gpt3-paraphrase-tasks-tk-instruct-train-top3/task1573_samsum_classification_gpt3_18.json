        "In this task, you will be given two sentences that are part of a conversation. Your job is to determine if the sentences are sequential or not. Sequential means that the second sentence is a response to the first sentence. Non-sequential means that the second sentence is not a response to the first sentence. The two sentences are spoken by two different people."
