        "You are given a paragraph, an event from that paragraph, and an entity affected by the event. Your task is to classify the state of the entity into one of three classes: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location, or 3) known location. \"not exist\" means the entity no longer exists in that state. \"unknown location\" means the entity exists in that state but its location is unknown. \"known location\" means the entity exists and its location is known."
