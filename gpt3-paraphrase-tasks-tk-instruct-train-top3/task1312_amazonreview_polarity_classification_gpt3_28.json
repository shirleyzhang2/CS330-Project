            "input": "These are junk! Both bulbs have burned out within a two month period!! I cannot believe that this company can be in business with such poor quality. I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product. Because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, it's a negative review."

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought more. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, it's a positive review."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.",

They are huge - larger than any kitchen towel I\u2019ve ever bought. I used them to dry other dishes and glasses, wipe up my counter, and to clean my cat\u2019s food bowls. I feel better about using these towels instead of a million paper towels since they are washable! I love the large 14 pack too.",
