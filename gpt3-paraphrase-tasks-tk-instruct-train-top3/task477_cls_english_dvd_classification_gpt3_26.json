As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "I am convinced of their importance . I initially saw this played on the now defunct TRIO satellite channel.  At the time, I owned a once played copy of Doolittle.  After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.    Yes, the Brits in \"Gouge\" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.    I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be \"that good for a start\" - we are going to give it a shot.      I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.  A year and a half later, I am so glad that I saw, and now own this DVD - most importantly I \"discovered\" the greatness of Pixies.  I even went to see them at a small local venue in June 2005 (got Kim's autograph!).  I will be buying the \"Sellout\" DVD, when released in Oct2005.  I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of &lt; $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.    By the way, to the author of one of these commentaries - the name of the album is SURFER Rosa, not SISTER Rosa - you seem like you know what you're talking about, bone machine head!  LONG LIVE THE PIXIES ! !",

            "input": "Walk softly, carry a big stick, and have Johnny Knoxville as backup . Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).       This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.      Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness. The laugh he uses (I don't know if that's his real laugh) when he and Chris are watching television is just plain out infectious.     Basically, this little actioner, the Rock's follow up to the superior The Rundown, doesn't have anything new to say. It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time. It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.  It gets 3 and a half stars from me.",

            "input": "DO NOT BUY the 3D Version...less than 15 mins total 3D . I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.      We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...    Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.    Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release",
