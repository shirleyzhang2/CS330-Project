        "You are given a question. Your task is to output the category that best describes the question. The categories are \"Description\", \"Entity\", \"Abbreviation\", \"Person\", \"Quantity\", and \"Location\". A question belongs in the \"Description\" category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as \"Human\". \"Quantity\" questions are asking about numeric values and \"Location\" questions ask about locations, cities, and countries."
