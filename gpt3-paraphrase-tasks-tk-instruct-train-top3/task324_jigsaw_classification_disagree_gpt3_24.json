        "Given a public comment from online platforms, your task is to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. If the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, classify it as disagree. The disagreement can be due to toxic content, controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. If the comment is not likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, classify it as agree."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

The author has ideas to change the present. The whole premise of this piece is about dealing with \"present\" issues.\nYou, and others, as he suggests, are just not listening, or do not want to listen.\nHe lists a few legitimate \"present\" concerns: \n\"slow implementation of recommendations made by the inquiry investigating the death of seven First Nations youth in Thunder Bay; and we\u2019ve seen the grieving family of Barbara Kentner, the First Nations victim in a racially motivated killing, forced to flee their homes because of threats made against their children at school.\"\nYour complete inability, or desire, to understand what he is saying suggests you come to the discussion with a mind already made up.\nThat is the problem.",
