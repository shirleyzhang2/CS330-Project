            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "Scholarly, Thorough, Thought Provoking . Hamlet's Mill: An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human Knowledge And It's Transmission Through Myth    GIORGIO de SANTILLANA & HERTHA von DECHEND    Hamlet's Mill is an amazing piece of macrocosmic literature that should be recognized as a true classic.     While some scholars and researchers may attempt to discredit this work as attempting to pull together unrelated mythology from distant times and cultures, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Nearly all religions are based upon two primary foundations, the first being astrotheology, the second being the use of entheogens; as above, so below.     While the stars in the sky may show differently at different locations, and the plants in a specific vicinity may be different, this does not negate the overall concept of the foundations being the same.     Santillana & Dechend have done a fantastic job at providing evidence that the knowledge of the Precession of the Equinoxes is far older than can be escaped, downplayed, or ignored.     The cultural myths, though slightly varying by time and distance have the same foundations, the same origins because they're based on the same concept...the stars and heavens...know the heavens or die... essential knowledge for planting, harvesting and storing food as well as for preparing for seasonal changes.     This is a most important book of many for understanding the ancient mysteries. Other books that will help the reader understand these concepts include John Allegro, Acharya S., Robert Hewitt Brown, Gordon Wasson, John Major Jenkins, Peter Lamborn Wilson, Jonathon Ott, Terence McKenna, G. Schiaparelli, Albert Hofmann, Richard Schultes, Christian Ratsch, Joseph Campbell, Manly P. Hall, Kersey Graves, Jordan Maxwell, Ernest Busenbark, Gerald Massey,  etc., to name a few.     One draw back to the book is that the authors skipped over the highly important microcosmic research of R. Gordon Wasson which was available at the time. A tying together of these two works (Hamlet's Mill and Soma), as Jenkins discovered (Maya Cosmogenesis 2012), can not be over looked and is a most rewarding discovery.     A solid 5 star work",

            "input": "Not a feel good parenting memoir . In our house we call somebody like Rachel a Whineramer. She really knows how to complain. But she writes so well, you don't care.    She had one passage where she describes the ideal (and unlikeliness) of the baby bottle coming out of the sterilizer, getting filled and passing to the baby's mouth without being contaminated. Funny stuff.    I found the book to be empowering. I felt as a parent, I was just a little better than she was. That is her gift. Like Jesus, Rachel crucifies herself as a crummy mother so that the rest of us can feel OK about ourselves",
