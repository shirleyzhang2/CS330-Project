Saudi Arabia executes gays, publicly beheads people, removes hands as a form of punishment, crucifies people, bans non-muslims from some cities, has a complete ban on non-muslim religions and oppresses women.\n\nYet our government supports Saudi Arabia. Look at Qatar and other \"moderate\" muslim countries like Kuwait and the UAE ....... how do they treat gays, women, and religious minorities? They all support fundamentalist islam. Yet they all escape criticism from the government. Freeland is comfortable criticizing Russia for its many abuses, but compared to our pretend allies in the Middle East, Russia is a liberal paradise.\n\nWhy the double standard?",
