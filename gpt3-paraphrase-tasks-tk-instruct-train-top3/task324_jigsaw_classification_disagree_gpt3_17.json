            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

Schools are not allowed to put on a Christmas concert in December - it is now called a winter concert. However, one particular group of people, new to this country, are allowed to practice their religion within the walls of our supposedly secular school system? I don't know whether to laugh or cry.",

We hate the niqab and burqa too but realise that they will not disappear with a ban. The only thing Europe has succeeded in doing with their bans is to further ghettoise and isolate the Muslim communities, which makes it easier for radicalisation. Things change by having subsequent generations integrate more into mainstream and secular society, something that Canada does fairly well. It's slow (a matter of generations) but effective, particularly since we do not have nowhere near the same level of influx Europe has.",
