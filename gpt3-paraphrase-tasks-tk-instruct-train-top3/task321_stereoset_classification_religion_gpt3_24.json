        "You will be given two sentences and a target. The first sentence will be a stereotype about a certain group of people. The second sentence will be either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
