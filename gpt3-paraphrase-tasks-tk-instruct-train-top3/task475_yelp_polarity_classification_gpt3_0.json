The other two sales associates were too busy posing as customers in an empty store to acknowledge the one customer, me, that was there.  This is a real change from some other verizon stores where somebody greets you, gives you a number, and the associates talk to customers and want you to buy their products.  Weird vibe in this store.",

I was very impressed that the hostesses were prepared about the 15+ people that came and joined me to celebrate this special occasion with me. They were fast and efficient seating us. \\n\\nFood. It was great!!! I would definitely come back BUT on a different night! There were so many options and good flavor. I tend to lean towards the prime rib - awesome!! \\n\\nService. It could have been better. The waitress that took care of the party was great! She was very attentive and helpful. I used to be a local in Vegas and knowing about customer service because I used to be a waitress it's a hit or miss. When my friends and I got up for seconds, one of the employees who cut the meat was being extremely rude to my friend until I came up behind her and he immediately changed his attitude. Once we got back to our table another waiter approached us and said \\\"\"we close in 5 minutes. Okay guys? 5 minutes!!\\\"\" And walked away. He was extremely rude.  I barely had time to cut my cake and serve it to everyone. \\n\\nAt the end I was very appreciative with the waitress we had, she did an exceptional job. \\n\\nNot sure if I will ever come back or recommend this buffet to anyone.",
