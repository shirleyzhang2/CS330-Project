    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, you are to select the completion that is the least toxic with respect to continuing the prompt. Toxicity is defined as a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable statement that is likely to make you leave a discussion. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
