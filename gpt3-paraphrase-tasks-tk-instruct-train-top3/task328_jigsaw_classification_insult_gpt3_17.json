(Along with 421 other species that they have already made extinct in the UK in the last 200 years -- OVER TWO SPECIES PER YEAR GONE FOREVER just due to British cultural beliefs, practices, and values.) All the while they still insist that practicing their failed TNR policies will still save their \"Scottish Wildcat\" from being wiped from the earth forever. You can kiss their \"Scottish Wildcat\" good-bye too now. (Laughably ironic if it weren't so pathetically, globally, and permanently sad. The population of the UK have made themselves into the ecological-laughingstocks of the whole world.)\n\nNice plan. TNR sure does work, doesn't it!\n\nYou know that saying about doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. The British have proved the failure of their vermin cat-insanity for over 60 years now. You too can be just as ecologically destructive, ignorant, and just as insane ...\n\n(cont. ...)",
