I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

No sort of brake on the wheels so always have to lay flat. Can\u2019t prop up on condo room wall for instance. Then the true test! I try to use it to carry light weight items like towels and beach bags and it was a total fail. The product has a bigger hassle trying to wrangle around than anything! I honestly got so aggravated that I never even took it to the beach to use as a chair so I can\u2019t review that part of the products functionality. Finally with only a 30 day window to return (ordered on May 1st for a May 18th 10 day vacay) i decided to just leave the piece of crap behind rather than wrangle it back home and try to re-package and return before the deadline.
