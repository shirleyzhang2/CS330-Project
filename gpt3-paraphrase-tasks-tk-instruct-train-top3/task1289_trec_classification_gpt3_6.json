If the question asks about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated, it belongs to the abbreviation category. If the question asks about human beings, description of a person, or a group or organization of persons, it belongs to the person category. If the question asks about numeric values, it belongs to the quantity category. If the question asks about locations, cities, or countries, it belongs to the location category."
