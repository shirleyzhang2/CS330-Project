        "You will be given a short poem which is written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. If the kid is in 1st to 6th grade, they will be considered as in elementary school. If the kid is in 7th to 12th grade, they will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output and it cannot have both categories at a time."
