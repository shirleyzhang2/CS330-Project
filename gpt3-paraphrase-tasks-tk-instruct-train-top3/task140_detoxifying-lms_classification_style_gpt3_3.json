    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions, select the completion that has the most similar style to the prompt. Style is defined as the tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure throughout the prompt-completion pair. If a prompt is colloquial, then the completion should also be colloquial. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
