            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now. But I hope more smiling faces will be drawn on it. \n Questions: When has the poem been written? \n Options: (A) At the beginning of the last semester. (B) At the end of the year.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them. (C) Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy. (D) Because many reporters have shown the problem of the systems. \n Answer: D",

            "input": "Article: Lonely Planet Publications is the largest guidebook publisher in the world.  With over 650 titles sold in 118 countries, it annually sells six million copies, giving guidance to travelers in locations worldwide. Tony Wheeler and his wife Maureen Wheeler were the founders of Lonely Planet Publications and its first writers. They put together Lonely Planet's first publication- Across Asia on the Cheap.  Originally from Australia,  the couple had decided to travel from Europe back home to Australia overland-going through the countries of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and South-East Asia, to eventually reach Australia. Tourist facilitres were limited in these countries, so if travelers wanted to go there, they had to eat and sleep locally. Many of these travelers were young and adventurous, but they didn't have much money, so going local was the only way that they could afford to travel across Asia. Frustrated that there was no guidebook to give budget travelers information on accommodations, food, and transport in these regions, the Wheelers decided to write a guidebook themselves. Full of humor and strong opinions, the book became famous among backpackers-budget travelers-as the chief travel guide for Asia. It made enough money for the Wheelers to travel more and finance their second book about traveling in Southeast Asia on a Shoestring. This second book became even more popular and acquired readership outside of Australia in North America, Europe, and New Zealand. Sales developed so well that the Wheelers were able to open up a publishing house in Australia, and eventually opened up offices in the United States and Europe. Because the guidebooks were based off contributing writer's experiences, material was fresh and up to date. As more and more books were written, the series finally came to cover every country in the world. \n Question: What is the passage mainly about? \n Options: (A) How the Lonely Planet Publications developed. (B) How to have a trip in an economical way. (C) The Wheelers liked traveling around the world. (D) The Wheelers wrote two books about traveling. \n Asnwer: D",

Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ramallah in December , 2001 . When they saw the attackers coming , Arafat's bodyguards ignored his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground . Seconds later , several bombs were dropped nearby . Though safe , his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat . But , Arafat , with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away , showed no fear at all . He stayed in the damaged office , talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel .  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others . But has he used up the last of his nine lives ? Only time will tell . \n Question: Which of the following statements cannot be used to describe Arafat ? \n Options: (A) He went to visit a few foreign countries last year.
