As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "explanation": "As these reviews are written by people, they may have typos and grammatical issues. Here the word \"boring\" is missplled, but it is still obvious that the review is a negative one."

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

Here we have another movie with Ms. Whurer and it is just like most of her movies very very poorly acted and just a waste of time and film for that matter. If all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you.  If you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than I sugest that you don't waste your time and money.  I guess when they cast for an actress here all they were looking for was how well she looks with no clothing on and did not pay attention to the simple fact that this woman has no talent",

Oh my God, I can't believe they actually released this movie onto video! ...I had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film....thank GOD it was on HBO (I actually thought it was an HBO  made-for-tv movie)...anyways, this movie was SOOO bad, I'm surprised that  the Air Force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this  movie..seriously..there's no plot and horrendous acting, but what can you  expect from a movie with the title &quot;Stealth Fighter&quot;?  Besides  that, the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny....like the  ending, I won't ruin it or anything (wouldn't that be bad! )......just  don't bend over to pick up your beer (probably #12 by that point in the  movie) because you might miss the whole ending...it's over that quick!    One example of why this movie stinks so bad: Ice-T WALKS onto an Airforce  base...decides to meander over to a hanger, knocks down a couple of  &lt;good&gt; guys that look like offensive-tackle-types...then just jumps  into a Stealth fighter (that happens to have the keys in it, and is fully  gassed up)...and flies away non-chalantly....and he doesn't even rap!   Anyways, might be good if you're inebriated and need a good  laugh....otherwise, avoid this like a port-a-potty at a Buffet  concert...like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy  from the Simpsons, &quot;Worst.....movie......ever! &quot",

            "input": "Much needed and appreciated... . While this might not be for everyone, it is something to behold. I happened upon the 'O' show, as she spoke about it (wayback when) and I was very intrigued. Before that episode ended, my order was being placed for the DVD version, here. I purchased the CD version, after watching the movie. It was beyond words (I found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie) and I'm incorporating the Secret in my life as well as my family. I listen to the CD version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work, at night. It has helped me immensely and I'll continue to do so. I'm so very glad that I decided to check here for the hardcover book...hooray, the price has been reduced...yipeee! I'll get that as soon as I'm done with this review. Thanks Rhonda Byrne and aloha from Hawaii",
