    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a pair of words. Your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The possible types of relations are 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. 'HYPER' means that the first word is a specific instance of the second word. 'COORD' means that the first word and the second word belong to the same semantic class. 'RANDOM' means that neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable."
