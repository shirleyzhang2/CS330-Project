I didn't see him, in my right peripheral vision, until a few seconds before he hit me. \n\nStand on any street corner downtown and see drivers breaking the law against driving through a crosswalk while a pedestrian is in them. You can also see them talking on their cell phones. There seems to be no law enforcement. I was told by someone who works for the city that this is due to a \"lack of resources\". I guess harassing the homeless to drive them out of downtown is a higher priority.",
