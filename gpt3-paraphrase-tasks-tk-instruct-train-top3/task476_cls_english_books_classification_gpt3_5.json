            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "Not a GOOD detective! . Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.    Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.    It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.    Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment",
