    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head is the event that happens first, and Tail is the event that happens after Head. PersonX is always the subject of the Head event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head event, PersonY or others will be affected as mentioned in the Tail event. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. For example, if X gets hugged, Y may blush in response. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
