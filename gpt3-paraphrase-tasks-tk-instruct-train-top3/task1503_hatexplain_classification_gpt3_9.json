        "The input is a tweet. The tweet can be classified as Hate Speech, Offensive, or Normal. Hate Speech and Offensive tweets target one community. Given such a tweet, output the community that is targeted in the tweet. There are nine possible values for the community: 'African', 'Islam', 'Jewish', 'Women', 'Refugee', 'Arab', 'Caucasian', 'Hispanic', or 'Asian'. If the tweet does not target any community, output 'None'. A tweet can only target one community."
