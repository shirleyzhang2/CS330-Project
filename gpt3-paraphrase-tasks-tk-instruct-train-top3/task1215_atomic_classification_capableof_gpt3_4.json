        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, you have to determine whether the Head is capable of the Tail or not.

It also includes specialized capabilities such as a surgeon is capable of operating on a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
