I can legally work for less than the minimum wage so that I can attain employment as is my right. What this profound stupidity has done is kill trickle up economics 101, and is going to force people to work under the table illegally in order to gain employment. This is not equal rights and equal opportunity. Jobs that once provided priceless opportunity to attain skills and experience needed to attain better paying jobs now require skills and experience to attain.
