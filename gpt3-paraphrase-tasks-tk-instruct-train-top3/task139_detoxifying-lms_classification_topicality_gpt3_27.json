    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, you are to select the completion that is more topical with respect to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is defined as topical if the completion maintains relevance and logical succession (i.e. stays on topic) with the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be reasonable. Output either Completion A or Completion B."
