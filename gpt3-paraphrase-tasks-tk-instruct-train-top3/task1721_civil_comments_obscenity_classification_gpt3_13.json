Otherwise you look uneducated and foolish.\n\nThe fact is, for the last 25 years the birthrate among teens has been steadily dropping. In 1991 it was 61.8 per 100,000 15 to 19 year olds. In 2014 it was 24.2 per 100,000. That is a significant drop of almost 2/3s.  Studies have shown the sex education is the biggest factor in this decline. Places which have limited or no sex ed have higher birth rates among teen mothers.\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/reproductive-health/teen-pregnancy/trends.html#",
