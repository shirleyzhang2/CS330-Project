I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Polarity: negative",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Polarity: positive",

This bidet is my first try at such devices and bought it because it was cheap and my interest was piqued. It has cut the need to TP way down and really leaves a bum feeling clean and refreshed. Can't speak for the ladies, however. My wife is still giving it the stink eye so I'm not sure if she is using it in secret or not. I don't check or ask. We have the cold water model only but I find it refreshing as the bum is not as prone to shock as the rest of the body. If you have been thinking about buying a bidet attachment, this has been a good one. \n Polarity: negative",
