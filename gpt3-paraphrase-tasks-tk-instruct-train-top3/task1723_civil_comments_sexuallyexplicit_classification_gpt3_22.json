Male, Female, Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual or Transgender is pretty irrelevant for me.  What are your polices and beliefs are what I'm interested in.   For Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright, sex defines their politics and that's kind of sad.  Any woman is better than any man seems to be their mantra.  I'm glad to see that the younger generation seems to have a more liberal attitude than these old warriors who can't forget the past.",
