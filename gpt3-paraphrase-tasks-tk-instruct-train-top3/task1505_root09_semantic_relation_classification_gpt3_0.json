    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y have the same meaning. A HYPER relationship applies when Y is a more general term than X. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM."
