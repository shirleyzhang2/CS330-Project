After having the most epic bachelorette celebration the night before, it was necessary for us to refuel for the trip back to Cali. Since we were staying at the Signature and couldn't bear to mission it anywhere else for brunch, we decided to go to the buffet at MGM. It was awesome that were no lines and we were immediately seated. \\nThough I was definitely hurting from the 6 bottles of drank that we killed the night before, I managed to appreciate the quality of the brunch selections. I loved how I was able to satisfy my hangoverness with different plates of breakfast and lunch items. Overall, if you're in the MGM and looking for a variety of things to eat then definitely check this buffet out.",

Our big disappointment came with the Betty's signature salad, which contained mixed greens, candied nuts, pears and gorgonzola. The pears were canned! To me, a restaurant serving pears from a can is unacceptable.\\nI really wanted to like this place, but doubt I will go back.",

The keg blew mid-pour, so the bartender told me she'd \\\"\"top me off\\\"\" after it was replaced. An hour later, she brought out a highball glass with exactly the amount that was missing from my pint, rather than just giving me a full pour for the inconvenience. Awesome how she saved Fox Sports a nickle like that.\\n\\nI rest my case...",
