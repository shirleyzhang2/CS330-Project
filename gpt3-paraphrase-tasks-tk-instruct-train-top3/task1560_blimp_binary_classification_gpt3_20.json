        "You will be given an English sentence. You need to output 'good' if the sentence is a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. You need to output 'bad' if the sentence is incorrect, meaning that the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match."
