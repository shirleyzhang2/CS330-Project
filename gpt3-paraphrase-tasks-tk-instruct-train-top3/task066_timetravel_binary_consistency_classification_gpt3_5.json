    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You will also be given a candidate sentence for the second sentence. Your task is to determine if the candidate sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it does, output \"Yes\". If it does not, output \"No\". The candidate sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, such that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
