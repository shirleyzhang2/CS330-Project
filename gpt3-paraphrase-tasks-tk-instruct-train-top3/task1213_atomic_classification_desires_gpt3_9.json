        "Given two phrases (Head and Tail) separated by <sep>, you must determine whether it is plausible for the Head to desire the Tail or not. In this task, desire means desires of sentient entities. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
