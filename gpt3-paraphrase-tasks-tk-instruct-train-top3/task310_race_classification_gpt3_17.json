            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them.

Staff and volunteers have named it \"Ni Hao,\" which is Chinese for \"hello.\" It was discovered breathing shallowly after a two-week trip across the Pacific Ocean. The cat was seriously suffering from loss of water and starvation when the container was opened in California last week, but was said to be doing well after being sent to the Carson Animal Care Center in Los Angeles. At first it was too weak to stand, but finally took its first steps. Then it ate a good meal and slept soundly. The cat woke up Thursday morning, physically in a better condition than 24 hours ago. \"Ni Hao greeted the medical team with its first miaow this morning and is attempting to stand,\" said Marcia Mayeda, head of the Los Angeles Department of Animal Care and Control. Aaron Reyes, director of the Department, added: \"We finally got to hear its voice. It sounds like a single-engine plane.\" Ni Hao is expected to be observed for 60 days but afterwards animal workers will look forward to providing it with a good shelter. \"It's much better for it to recover in a home environment,\" Mr Reyes said. \"It's just like a human being in a hospital so we're hoping to move it.\" He added: \"Little by little we're getting there. We're hoping that under the treatment and with rest, it'll be able to recover quickly.''

            "input": "Article: Psychologists  have known that what's going on inside our head affects our senses. For example, poorer children think coins are larger than they are, and hungry people think pictures of food are brighter. Professor Remi Radel wanted to investigate(look into) how this happens -- whether it's right away, as the brain receives signals from the eyes, or a little later, as the brain's higher-level thinking processes get involved. Radel chose 42 students and each student was told to arrive at the lab at noon after three or four hours of not eating on the day of the test. Then they were told there was a delay. Some were told to come back in 10 minutes; others were given an hour to get lunch. So half the students were hungry when they did the experiment and the other half had just eaten. For the experiment, the participant looked at a computer screen. One by one, 80 words flashed on the screen. A quarter of the words were food-related. After each word, the person was asked how bright the word was and asked to choose which of two words they'd seen -- a food-related word like gateau (cake) or a neutral   word like bateau (boat). Hungry people saw the food-related words as brighter and were better at identifying food-related words. Because the word appeared too quickly for them to be reliably seen, this means that the difference is in perception  , Radel says--it's not because of some kind of processing happening in the brain after you've already figured out what you're looking at. \"This is something great to me, that humans can really realize what they need or what they hope for, to know that our brain can really arrange for our motives and needs,\" Radel says. \"There is something inside us that selects information in the world to make life easier.\" \n Question: The purpose of Radel's research is to let us know    _   . \n Options: (A) how our thinking has effect on our senses happens (B) what it is the good time for students to have lunch (C) whether poorer children think coins are larger than they are (D) whether hungry people think pictures of food are brighter \n Asnwer: C",

            "input": "Article: The word I'm going to introduce to you today is-phubbing. Let's see the definition of this term:phubbing n. the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your cell phone instead of paying attention As you can probably guess, phubbing is a blend of phone and snubbing. The term was coined by a 23-year-old Melbourne resident Alex Haigh. Obviously, he got fed up with how people are always checking Facebook or Twitter on their phones when they are supposed to be interacting with someone face to face. He wanted to put an end to this social phenomenon, therefore he came up with this catchy term. And it did catch on. The word's earliest media mention dates back to June 2012, and in a little over a year's time, phubbing has already been picked up by almost all the mainstream media outlets one can think of. Here is a typical example from the British newspaper The Independent. In the article titled The Rise of Phubbing, which was published on August 5, 2013, Tom Chatfield writes, there's an uncomfortable truth at the heart of phubbing: other people are easier to handle when seen on screen. They're less likely to demand unreasonable efforts such as undivided attention or clean shirts. While the term phubbing has undoubtedly taken off, some people question why it is called phubbing instead of phnubbing. Alex Haigh has not personally addressed the issue, but word has it that phubbing sounds more crispy and thus easier to remember. Phubbing is indeed a univers al problem that can no longer be ignored. So why do people keep phubbing each other if they know it's rude? Is there anything we can do to stop it? Or maybe we should just be more kind, because sometimes there are good excuses to phub. I think there is plenty we can do to try and stop phubbing. For starters, we can jo in Alex Haigh in his Stop Phubbing campaign. Remind our friends and family that phubbing is not appreciated. We can also make or download some anti-phubbing posters to spread the word in public places. And don't forget that some phubbers simply do not realize the harmful effect their behavior has on others,so be b rave enough to stop them, even if you are a total stranger. \n Question: This passage is mainly talking about   _  . \n Options: (A) the rise of phubbing in all the mainstream media outlets (B) a new term \"phubbing\"and its problem (C) the campaign of keeping phubbing (D) different opinions on phubbing \n Asnwer: B",
