Again, may I suggest disagreeing with you on this issue or any other does make a person, ipso facto, \"ill-informed.\" I could reply with a like comment and we could waste time and energy exchanging insults.  I'm not interested in doing that. \n\n We know, although you and the others who support this law will never acknowledge it,  that it was specifically written to \"discourage\" panhandling by punishing anyone who donats to panhandlers from a car.   This ban, of course, eliminates the primary source of contributions to panhandlers. It's designed to give Springfield panhandlers the \"bum's rush\", while hopefully passing the test of its Constitutionality.  It may be supported by the Courts, it may not be.  As I've repeatedly said, that is the Courts' responsibility.  We'll likely get to see how it \"plays out.\"",
