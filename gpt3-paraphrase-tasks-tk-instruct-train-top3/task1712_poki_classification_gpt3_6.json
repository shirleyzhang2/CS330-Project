        "You will be given a short poem, and your task is to predict if the poem's author is in elementary school or high school. Authors in grades 1-6 will be considered as elementary school students, and those in grades 7-12 will be considered as high school students. There are only two possible outputs: 'elementary' and 'high'. Every input will have at least one output, and no input will have both outputs."
