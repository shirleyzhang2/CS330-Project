        "You are given a question. You need to detect which category best describes the question. The categories are \"Description\", \"Entity\", \"Abbreviation\", \"Person\", \"Quantity\", and \"Location\". A question belongs in the \"Description\" category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions that are abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as \"Human\". Quantity questions are asking about numeric values and Location questions ask about locations, cities, and countries."
