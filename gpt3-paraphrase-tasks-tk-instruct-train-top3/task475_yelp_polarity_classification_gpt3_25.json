I live the French toast a lot of my friends get the huervos rancheros. \\n\\nFor lunch my favorite is the chicken-Roma sand which. If you ask what the most popular lunch is they're likely to say this. Everything here is great though- and healthy!\\n\\nThe smoothies are bomb too!",

            "input": "We came to the Grand Wok for dinner before hitting the clubs at my bachelorette party. We had a party of 6 with no reservation (they only take reservations for very large parties) and got a table right away. The place has a great atmosphere, and was a little quiet when we were there, which was nice b/c we could actually all have a conversation. \\nWe each ordered different sushi rolls, which we all pretty average price wise. Most rolls ran around $12-$18 which was great for the size of the rolls and the ingredients. I had the Red Dragon roll and it was sooo yummy! Actually all of the rolls were great and everyone in our party was super happy with what they ordered. We also shared an order of Orange Chicken, which didn't come with rice (weird) and was tasty but had a different texture than Orange Chicken i've had before... a little weird, but not bad. We also ordered the Combination Fried Rice which had all kinds of goodies in it like lobster, shrimp, pork, chicken... basically all the meats you can think of... it was super tasty but it was way over priced, $18 for a plate of rice that might not even fill up one person :( \\nOr bill for 6 came to around $170 which is pretty great for sushi on the strip! Service was prompt and the food was delish! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to grab sushi w/ out breaking the bank!",

            "input": "I used to enjoy this place. I would go here at least 1-2 a month for the past few years. Great for local and south end living. also can get a industry card which is great. However, the Service has really taken a turn for the worse. Bartenders are too cool for school and seem judge people on wallet size. I was dressed down and didn't look like a total tool-bag, which is the client type the serve now a days, they kinda blew me off. the food is ok. I do believe it has ALWAYS been overpriced but yet again the industry card. Now everytime I go there, LOUD bands kill all conversation. I can't remember a time a band HASN'T played there in the recent times I've been there. I like Live music, but this place really doesn't seem to be geared for Live music. Really, If the Bartenders weren't pure garbage, this place would get back to an average to very good rating",
