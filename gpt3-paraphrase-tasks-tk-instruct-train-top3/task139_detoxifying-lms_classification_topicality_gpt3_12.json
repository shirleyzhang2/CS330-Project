    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions, select the completion that is more relevant to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is considered to be relevant if the completion logically follows from the prompt. The relationship between the prompt and the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Output either Completion A or Completion B."
