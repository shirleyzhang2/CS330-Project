            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now. But I hope more smiling faces will be drawn on it. \n Questions: When has the poem been written? \n Options: (A) At the beginning of the last semester. (B) At the end of the year.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them. (C) Because it is thought to threaten users' privacy. (D) Because many reporters have shown the problem of the systems. \n Answer: D",

Ravens  are like superheroes. Well, sort of.Legend says if the ravens that live on the Tower grounds ever leave, the Tower will fall apart.No one knows when the ravens first showed up, but Charles II took the legend so seriously that in the 1670s he gave an official order that six ravens be kept there all the time.Today there are still always six. You might have lived at a zoo. In 1204, King John kept a collection of animals, including lions and elephants.About 50 years later, King Henry III received a polar bear.the bear was kept on a piece of rope so it could fish from the Thames River that flows by the Tower. If you lived at the Tower today, your mom or dad might be in charge. The 35 Yeoman Warders and their families are among the few still allowed to live at the Tower.Established in 1509 a;? bodyguards! for the king, today they give tours and  manage the day-to-day details of the Tower.They're called \"beefeaters,\" possibly because their job once allowed them to eat beef from the king's; table. You need a secret password at night. Called the \"Word,\" the password changes every 24 hours and is a must-have to enter the Tower after hours.It's written on a piece of paper and delivered to the Yeoman on duty for, the night. You could find buried gold. In 1662, a goldsmith  named John Barfcstead supposedly hid more than $40,000 worth of stolen gold somewhere on.the Tower grounds.Many have searched for the gold, but it has never been found. \n Question: Charles II decided to keep six ravens in the Tower probably because   _  ,.         ; \n Options: (A) he loved animals a lot (B) he believed ravens helped protect the Tower (C) he wanted to train the ravens to watch the prisoners (D) he thought the Tower was a cool place for the ravens to live \n Asnwer: D",

For example, consider these words: know, design, island, school, wrist, naughty, and salmon. All of these words have at least one letter that is not typically pronounced, and these words are just a very small part of words with silent letters in them. Some words are even worse, consider this word: colonel. Not only are some letters not pronounced, but letters that are not even there are pronounced. Even foreign languages, especially French, are guilty of this needless complexity and confusion. I know there must be some main historical reasons why the words are spelled and pronounced the way they are, but that does not mean bad traditions must continue to survive. Especially if they are no longer logical. Unfortunately, there is very little that anyone can do for it, because there's no group of people who can change or have the right to change the English language for everyone. However, the only thing we can do is make changes in the way we talk and write in hopes that it _ . For example, I pronounce the letter \"l\" in salmon on purpose to make people annoyed and to sound more different or complicated. I even pronounce colonel the correct or French way. I can only hope these two minor changes to the English language make sense to you, and you will help to keep up these minor changes forever in your everyday life. \n Question: Which of the following is the main reason for silent letters? \n Options: (A) French language.

ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away. Here is an example: A woman was doing washing. Suddenly she shouted, \"My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!\" Just then, a telephone came. The woman's father had died of a heart illness. He died sitting in a chair. There are thousands of stories like this on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what is behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example ---- one of hundreds of dreams that have come true. A man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, \"There's room for one more.\" The man felt the driver was Death, so he ran away. The next day the man was getting on a crowded bus. The bus driver said, \"There's room for one more\". Then the man saw the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into fires. Everyone was killed! Some people say stories like these are lies or coincidences. Others say that are ESP in true, from studies of ESP, we may some day learn more about the human mind. \n Question: ESP lets people know about   _  . \n Options: (A) their dream (B) events after they happen (C) events before they happen (D) heart illness \n Asnwer: C",
