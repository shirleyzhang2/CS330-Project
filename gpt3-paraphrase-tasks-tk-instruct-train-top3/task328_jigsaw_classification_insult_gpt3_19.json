Evidence has since surfaced that suggest the killer had sex with Shepard but experienced self-loathing for it due to societal pressure then cracked. Regarding the Orlando killer, it's possible that he was gay, but he was a Muslim who lived with a woman he called his wife, and law enforcement officials have stated that he scoped out the nightclub where he killed people weeks before gunning those people down, and even went on Grindr in order to try and understand the mindset of gay men before he proceeded with his heinous atrocity. Some of the men he met on Grindr testified that they never had sex and that he was so \"creepy\" they left before anything happened.\n\nBut how telling that you would immediately jump to those particular conclusions in order to demonize all gay men as you typically do. Sick.",

It was all sweetness and light until we got to a passage  describing a husband's rights under Islam:  he may sometimes beat his wife, \"mais pas fort\" (but not hard). \n\nMost people consider my friend a model of open-mindedness, but she couldn't quite  come to terms with that line. Nor could I. But of course we'll be urged to be more \"tolerant\": after all, no one's going to beat us too hard.",
