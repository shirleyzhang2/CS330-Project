        "Given a sentence, your task is to judge the quality of the sentence by outputting \"Good\" or \"Bad\". The quality of the sentence depends on the grammar and the meaning of the sentence. If a sentence is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors, output \"Good\". Otherwise, output \"Bad\"."
