        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. no-need is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, suggesting that the item is up for grabs."
