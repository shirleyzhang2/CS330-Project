        "In this task, you will be given a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending. Your job is to choose the middle statement that makes the story incoherent / implausible. If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes less sense. To indicate your choice, output 1 or 2."

            "input": "Beginning: Butch had a really old computer. Middle 1: Butch decided to order a new computer online. Middle 2: Butch noticed that a storm was approaching to his town. Ending: It arrived and Butch was much happier.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "People generally don't feel happy about natural disasters like storms. Therefore, we choose 2 in this case."

            "input": "Beginning: John was on the trail running. Middle 1: John accelerated the speed and broke his leg accidentally. Middle 2: John was chased by a bear. Ending: He ran even faster until he got to his car safely.",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "When someone breaks his/her leg, it is difficult to run. Therefore, we choose 1 in this case."

            "input": "Beginning: Gina was putting posters on her bedroom walls. Middle 1: Gina wanted to match the colorful posters. Middle 2: Gina ripped the poster on accident. Ending: Gina decided she would wear more colorful clothing.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "In this example, both Middle sentences sound plausible, but the first one is MORE plausible as a story. Therefore, we choose 2 in this case."

            "input": "Beginning: Mary's mom came home with more bananas than they could possibly eat. Middle 1: Mary and her mom decided to make chocolate covered frozen bananas to avoid waste. Middle 2: So Mary made pineapple splits for everyone. Ending: That was the best way ever to eat a banana!",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "The story talks about bananas, so discussion of pineapples makes the story incoherent. Therefore, we should not choose 1 in this case."

            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "If a person is not caught committing a crime, they cannot go to prison. Therefore, we should not choose 1 in this case."
