When those occur, police departments need to re-evaluate their way of doing things.\n\nHowever, the biggest reform that should occur is the understanding that ALL LIVES MATTER. Cops should never treat the public as if we are all criminals in need of correction (or the Department of ), but as individuals who by and large aren't meaning to break the increasingly complex laws of this increasingly tyrannical government. If they approached all of their jobs in that way, there would be a whole lot fewer shootings, period! Any time a cop shoots a civilian, the facts should be screened by a citizen jury to assure there is no cover-up and if that jury decides there is cause, the cop should go to trial for Murder 1.
