I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

A great collection of Arts solo stuff, which include his 2 brillant chart no one`s &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; &amp; &quot;Bright Eyes.&quot; There is quite a few songs off &quot;The Art Garfunkel  Album&quot; such as the romantic &quot;I Believe When I Fall In Love It`ll  Be For Ever&quot;  &amp; &quot;99 Miles From L.A.&quot;   &quot;Watermark&quot; from the album from the same name. But surprisingly  only  a a couple of tracks, from the very well put together album  &quot;Fate For Breakfast.&quot; All in all it`s a great album, with a   great selection of songs.

I'm pretty new to these guys, figured I'd take some time to dig into German goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the US, by which I mean all the pioneers from the 70's or 80's are either gone, changed tracks, or sold out to that crappy early 90's House Tekno sound.    These guys have a little of that crappy House sound that you would expect from about 99% of the so called German Goth bands now a days (and sadly now Skinny Puppy as well), but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which I can really sink my teeth into, also some of it does kind of tug at the ol' psych a bit, which is a good thing, but it is no where near as amazing as Skinny Puppy was in its glory days...    ...everything pre-process, though the process was still \"pretty good\" for the most part",

            "input": "Live fast, die young, stay pretty....... . Like so many of the albums I now find myself trawling for, my first copy of The Slider was on good old 12\" vinyl. In that original incarnation it only included the first 13 tracks now included on the CD release. \"Thunderwing\" and \"Lady\" were, if memory serves me, first aired on the B-side of the \"Metal Guru\" single, while \"Cadillac\" (the great single-that-never-was in my opinion) never really seemd to find a home it was happy with. In feel it probably belongs with the sparser-sounding \"Zip Gun\" than with the lusher \"Slider\" or \"Tanx\" production. Purists may argue that \"Electric Warrior\" is the T.Rex album to own if you're only going to have the one, but it is essentially a transitional album bridging the gap between the earlier Tolkienesque folk period and the Glam that followed and ends up being neither one thing nor t'other. \"Slider\" lies firmly in the latter period and is as good an example of the strengths and weaknesses of Marc Bolan as writer and performer as you are likely to get. I can think of nobody else in the modern period who has been able to extract such a variety of results from the basic three-chord blues riff. It's a well documented fact that Bolan would have loved to be Elvis, and on the strength of this perhaps he wouldn't have made a bad job of it. It's too easy to treat some of the lyrics harshly, branding them \"pretentious\" or \"unintelligeable\", (although if it were early 20th century poetry it would be called \"hermetic\" and treated with reverence), but that's what Bolan was all about from first to last. T.Rex are probably pretty much of an unknown quantity to most American listeners outside of \"Get It on\" (with it's title inexplicably censored for transatlantic consumption). Here in Britain for 3 or so all too brief years he was the epitome of a pop star. \"Slider\" more than any other album illustrates what he was about before succumbing to McCartney's Syndrome and putting the wife on keyboards",
