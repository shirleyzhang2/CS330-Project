        "The task is to read medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE and classify them as non-adverse drug events or adverse drug events. An adverse drug reaction is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from the use of a medical product. It predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product."
