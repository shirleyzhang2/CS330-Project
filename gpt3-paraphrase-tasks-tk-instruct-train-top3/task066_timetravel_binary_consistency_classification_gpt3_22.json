        "Given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences, where the second sentence is missing, you need to identify if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences form a consistent story. Indicate your answer by \"Yes\" if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story, otherwise output \"No\"."
