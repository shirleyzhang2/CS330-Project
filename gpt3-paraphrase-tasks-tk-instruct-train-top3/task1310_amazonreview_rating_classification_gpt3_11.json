I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",
            "output": "5",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

This is big - too big and too \"in your face\" with any normal depth desk. horrible, horrible IPS glow. IN all fairness it is hard to get a pic of IPS glow but this is the best I can get. The center part should be black so the corners will be slightly dimmer than the mustard color in the pic - but size and position of it is accurate. This one is going back- I hope the replacement is better but I am not confident in it. For $1,200 this should be greatly reduced and WTH is up with the flip-phone sounding speakers it has? Gaming is ok on it, but it is nice for desktop space for multiple applications. so it gets 2 stars.",
