    "Definition": [
        "In this task you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. You must classify the type of irony the tweet has. There are three types of irony: polarity, situational, and other. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Other kinds of ironies are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
