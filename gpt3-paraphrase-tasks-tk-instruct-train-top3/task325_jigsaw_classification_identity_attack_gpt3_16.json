For such an imposition to be lawful, it must pass stringent legal tests, one of them being that the law goes no further than absolutely necessary to achieve a necessary goal. Another test is that there is no other way to achieve the goal that infringes less on the right.\n\nI don't see how criminalizing adults acting on consent to sex in the above situation comes within a country mile of passing those tests.",

I have read ten's of thousands+  of these articles.  The professional drug counselors will tell you, ONCE a USER and ADDICT, always an ADDICT.  There are a few ADDICT'S  that once they are in a professional RECOVERY program, can remain sober and abstain from using,  its a LIFETIME Program and very few can adhere to it that long.    The ones that do, I APPLAUD them.  \n\nThe only way I see to Eliminate alcohol and drug use in high school, college, professional sports, is CONTINUAL drug testing.  Its just that way,  ACCEPT IT,  its been going on for many decades,  its unfortunate that a few bad apples continue to ruin it for the majority.  \n\nI  would like to see Alcohol & Pot, All Drugs, BANNED...",
