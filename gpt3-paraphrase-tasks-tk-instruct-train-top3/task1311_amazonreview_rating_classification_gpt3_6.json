I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

I chose this one because it claimed to be an all season duvet cover and so far that's held up true for winter, I haven't gotten to test it out in summer yet. I needed something to keep me warm yet be light enough to not cause my fiance to sleep hot, I didn't notice that the covering was 100% polyester and thus he still sleeps hot yet not as much as before. This is the only downside I have found in this duvet so far besides the fact that it doesn't fit properly in the two cal king duvet covers i purchased separately, it's about 4 inches smaller than my covers. But all in all it is a thin duvet that keeps me warm and is soft to the touch so I'm happy with it \n Rating: 2",
