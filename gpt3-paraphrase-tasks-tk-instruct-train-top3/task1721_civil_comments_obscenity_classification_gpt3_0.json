She was charged with \"failing to render assistance\" (!) and sentenced to 18 months.  Do blondes have more fun?  They apparently get away with vehicular manslaughter of Yup'ik people!\n\n02/06/13--17 year-old Murphy Gross got high, stole daddy's SUV and T-boned another car, killing young mother of two Catherine Cope.  He got 8 months--the Judge felt he could be 'rehabilitated'.  Translation, he was white and Cope wasn't.\n\n07/19/14--17 year-old drunk driver Alexandra Ellis ran down 51 year-old bicyclist Jeff Dusenbury, killed him and fled.  The victim was white this time, but so was Ellis' daddy.  And he was a well-connected lawyer.  She got a year.\n\n03/12/16--26 year-old Native man Arnold Demboski, driving a snowmobile drunk, struck and killed a DOG. The Magistrate characterized his actions as '...an act of terrorism,\" a potentially capital crime.\n\nTHIS is why we need fewer white judges.",
