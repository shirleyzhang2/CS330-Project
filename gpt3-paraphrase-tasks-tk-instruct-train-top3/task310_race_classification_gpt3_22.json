            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh! It must have been written at the end of the last semester in middle school. Classmates had to leave school and good friends had to _ . What a sad poem! If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them. For years, the wall has witnessed  all the things that have happened in the classroom. I don't know how it will be next year, two years from now, or even ten years from now.

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\".

What do you ask? We'll say it again: \"No\". Sweet and simple \"no\". Say \"no\" at your office and see how quickly that pile of work on your desk disappears. \"Saying 'no' to others means you are saying 'yes' to yourself, \" said Leslie Charles, a professional speaker from East Lansing, Michigan. \"Time is precious. People are spending money buying time. And yet we are willing to give up our time because we can't say 'no'.\" Susie Watson, a famous writer, said people who always say \"yes\" need to say \"no\" without guilt or fear of punishment. \"I would rather have someone give me a loving 'no' than an obligated  'yes', \" she said. Susie Watson says she feels \"no\" obligation to give an explanation when she says \"no\" either socially or professionally. Does she feel guilty about it? \"Not at all, \" said Watson, who is director of advertising and public relations at Timex Corp in Middlebury, Conneticut. \"Most people are afraid of saying 'no'... My advice is to say 'yes' only if you don't mean 'no'.\" Watson said \"no\" is the most effective weapon against wasting time. \"Every year there are more demands on your time... Other people are happy to use up your time, \" Watson said. Time saving appears to be \"no's\" greatest friend. \"No\" can be your new friend, a powerful tool to take back your life. \"No\" may even take you further in the business world than \"yes\". \"No\" is power and strength. \"No\" now seems completely correct. \"Saying 'no' isn't easy. But finally it's greatly liberating,\" Charles said. But, he added, a \"no\" project needs to be worked on every day because it is hard to change long-term habit. But, he also warns: \"Don't go to extremes. Don't find yourself saying 'no' to everything. In return you should learn to hear 'no'.\" \n Question: The sentence \"Saying 'yes' to yourself\" means   _  . \n Options: (A) you can have more time to play with others (B) you needn't care about other's feeling if you are happy (C) you are selfish and treat others rudely (D) you can deal with your business as you have planned \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: Smart Exercise  Doctors are starting to find more and more information that suggests a connection between exercise and brain development. Judy Cameron, a scientist at Oregon Health and prefix = st1 /ScienceUniversity, studies brain development. According to her research, it seems that exercise can make blood vessels, including those in the brain, stronger and more fully developed. Dr. Cameron claims this allows people who exercise to concentrate better. As she says: \"While we already know that exercise is good for the heart, exercise can literally cause physical changes in the brain.\"  The effects of exercise on brain development can even be seen in babies. Babies who do activities that require a lot of movement and physical activity show greater brain development than babies who are less physically active. With babies, even a little movement can show big results. Margaret Barnes, a pediatrician  , believes in the importance of exercise. She thinks that many learning disabilities that children have in elementary school or high school can be traced back to a lack of movement as babies. \"Babies need movement that stimulates their five senses. They need to establish a connection between motion and memory. In this way, as they get older, children will begin to associate physical activity with higher learning,\" says Margaret.  Older people can beef uptheir brains as well.CornellUniversitystudied a group of seniors ranging in age from seventy to seventy-nine. Their study showed a short-term memory increase of up to 40 percent after exercising just three hours a week. The exercise does not have to be very difficult, but it does have to increase the heart rate. Also, just like the motion for infants, exercise for older people should involve some complexity. Learning some new skills or motions helps to open up memory paths in the brain that may not have been used for a long time.  For most people, any type of physical activity that increases the heart rate is helpful. The main goal is to increase the brain's flow of blood. And your brain can benefit from as little as two to three hours of exercise a week. \n Question: Research by Dr. Cameron seems to suggest that exercise can \n Options: (A) generate new blood vessels. (B) change the way a person thinks. (C) promote brain development. (D) divert one's attention. \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: I once had a house guest from Cuba. During his visit, I happened to throw an old broken blender   in the trash. The next day it was sitting on my counter - in working order. In his world, people simply cannot afford to replace an item which doesn't work properly. They take the time and figure out how to fix it. In Cuba, they are still driving cars from the 1960's, mainly because they do not have a choice. In contrast, the U.S. is a \"throw-away society.\" Statistics show that each American produces six pounds of trash per day. I believe a combination of factors has contributed to this phenomenon. \"Planned obsolescence \" is not a secret. It is a manufacturing   philosophy developed in the 1920's and 1930's, when mass production became popular. The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. This pressures the consumer to buy again. Planned obsolescence does keep costs down. Instead of making an expensive product that will last a long time, businesses produce more affordable, disposable  items. Some electronic items have become so inexpensive that it is cheaper to replace them than to repair them.[:&&Z&X&X&K] Busy people often value their time and convenience more than money. If a car starts to have mechanical problems, replacing it with a newer, more reliable model may be more appealing than tolerating it being in the garage for a week. In addition, advertising trains consumers to want what is new and improved. It convinces them that the more they have, the happier they will be. Unlike people in many developing countries, we live in a world of abundance. A study by Dr. Timothy Jones of the University of Arizona also found that in the U.S., 40-50 percent of all food ready for harvest is wasted. Abundance and waste soon became closely associated in the American way of life. \n Question: In Cuba, people usually fix a broken item instead of buying a new one because   _  . \n Options: (A) wasting is prohibited there (B) they are poor (C) they are interested in fixing things (D) they live a low-carbon life \n Asnwer: B",
