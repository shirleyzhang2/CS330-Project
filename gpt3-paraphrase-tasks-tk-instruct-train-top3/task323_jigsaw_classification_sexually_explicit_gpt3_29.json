(And nevermind the awful state of many addicts who nonetheless didn't die...)\nWe now have decades of proof: prohibition is a failed model.\nIt creates and encourages violent black markets, costs us untold millions in law enforcement and first response expenses, and .. oh yeah .. hasn't done _a thing_ to reduce the rate of drug use or accessibility in North America or anywhere else not run by a homicidal dictator named Duterte.\nWe've had decades of this garbage.
