            "input": "Thoroughly underwhelming. Crispy overdone meat, mediocre quality of ingredients no unique flavor.  Bobby Flay's place across the street should not worry. The only spark of innovation they have is a hamburger that's well over a pound.",

            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive (even though there is a negative phrase as part of the review). The right label should be 'POSITIVE' and not 'NEGATIVE'."

            "input": "Went to celebrate with a party of 15 and they wouldn't let me in with my daughter because after 4 PM it's considered a bar. Security was extremely lazy in getting management when I wanted to speak to him. Finally he came and explained its the law I understand and respected that so I asked if I could just speak with my party for 5-10 minutes before i left since I drove there and they would not let me eat and was declined. Never going to recommend this place to anybody since not even a simple request could be made, I know it's the law but you can bend it a little for the customer and afford a 5-10 minute conversation.",
