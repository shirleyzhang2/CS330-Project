    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple containing Head and Tail events, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be seen as mentioned in the Tail. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
