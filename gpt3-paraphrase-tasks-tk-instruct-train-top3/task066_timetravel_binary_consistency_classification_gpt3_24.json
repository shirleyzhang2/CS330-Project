        "You will receive a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. The second sentence is missing, and you are given a candidate sentence to fill the gap. You need to determine if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If the given sentence does not change the subsequent storyline such that at least one of the three subsequent sentences forms a consistent story, then indicate your answer as \"Yes\". Otherwise, indicate your answer as \"No\"."
