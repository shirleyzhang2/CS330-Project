In a touching tribute to the legend between the posts, Juve have decided to commemorate the occasion with a special exhibition at the club's museum in Turin. Buffon, who has also amassed 154 senior caps for Italy and won the FIFA World Cup with his country in 2006, joined The Old Lady in 2001 for \u00a332.6million, the record transfer fee for a goalkeeper which is yet to be broken.Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is one of the all-time greatsHe made his professional debut for Parma 20 years agoCurrent club Juve have marked the anniversary of that match with a special commemorative display in their museumBuffon has also amassed 154 caps for Italy and won the 2006 World Cup \n Questions:Juve, who won _ last season, are currently sixth in the table with 21 points from 13 games so far, nine points off the pace of leaders Inter Milan.
