    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. The small-talk strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip."
