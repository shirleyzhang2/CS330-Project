        "You will be given a context and a verb separated by a newline character. You have to answer whether the given verb can be anchored in time or not. A verb can be anchored in the real timeline if it happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time and \"No\" otherwise."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."

O'Donnell declined to discuss what federal charges were being pursued, but she said that in a case like this, potential charges would be abortion-related violence, the use of a firearm in an act of violence, crossing state lines to commit a crime, and, if the suspect's act was (tied) to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which prohibit an organized criminal enterprise.  \n Verb: tied",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
