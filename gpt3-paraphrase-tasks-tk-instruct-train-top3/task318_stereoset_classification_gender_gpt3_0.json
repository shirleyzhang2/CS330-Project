    "Definition": [
        "Given a target person and two sentences, determine whether the second sentence conveys either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. If there is no relevance between the sentences and targets, they are unrelated."
