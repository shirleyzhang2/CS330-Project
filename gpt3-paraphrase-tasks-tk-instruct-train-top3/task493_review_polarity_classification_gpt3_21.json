The plot does not flow well, the actors lines don't always fit in to the scene, the background music does nothing for the movie, & there is a love side story thrown in for good measure. The computer animation of the air battles is the only good thing about this movie. My wife & I both watched it together. We both did not enjoy it. While watching the movie I actually thought about just ending the movie early. My advice, rent it before you buy it!If you want to see good WWI movies, then watch: The Blue Max, Paths Of Glory, The Lost Battalion",
