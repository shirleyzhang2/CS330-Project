            "input": "boring.... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Jeff Golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say Bob James or the &quot;Crusaders&quot; They move from funky tunes, thru  soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious  uptempo grooves. This is really enjoyable instrumental work, familar but  never hackneyed. The musicianship is exemplary, tight and inspired  throughout. I'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly  reccomended",

            "input": "The price is right. . I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.    Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy",

Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk",
