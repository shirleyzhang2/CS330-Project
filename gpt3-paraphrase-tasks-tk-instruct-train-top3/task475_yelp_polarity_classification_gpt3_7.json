            "input": "First off, this restaurant is absolutely HUGE. there are a ton of tables, so i'm going to say that this place is good for groups..  When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\\n\\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\\n\\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\\n\\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.",

            "input": "Two years ago in January 2012, JUVE AUTO CLINIC replaced the brakes on my Toyota Avalon, front and back.  Yesterday I took my car back to Juve Auto Clinic as the rotor on the front right side was showing groves. They did an inspection and found the brake pad was faulty and because the pad was warranted they replaced both the rotor and the pad at no cost to me. They take good care of their customers!!  They sell only the best parts which have warranties on them.  They were polite and made sure the part was delivered in under an hour as they knew I had an appointment.  The staff is friendly and polite and you feel total trust in having them work on your car.  If you need any kind of car repair definitely consider JUVE AUTO CLNIC.  I still recommend them without reservation!!",
