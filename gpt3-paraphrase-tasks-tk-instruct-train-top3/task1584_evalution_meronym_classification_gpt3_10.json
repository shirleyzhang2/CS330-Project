        "Given an object and a part, you need to output 1 or 0 to indicate if the object has the given part. 1 means the object has the given part, while 0 means it doesn't have the part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts."
