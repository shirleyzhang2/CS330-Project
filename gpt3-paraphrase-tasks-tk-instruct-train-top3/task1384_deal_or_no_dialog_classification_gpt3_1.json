THEM: that was my opener so i expect counter offers of course, i don't really want the book and would much prefer the balls over anything else.  YOU: book has no value to me at all, i assume it'll give you minimal points. i'd be ok with two balls and the hat?  THEM: anyway i can get 3 balls?  YOU: that wouldn't allow me any points. i need to settle at 3 balls, or two balls and the hat ; can we make one of them work?
