        "You will receive a target race and two sentences. You need to determine the relationship between the sentences with respect to the target race. There are three possible relationships: stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
