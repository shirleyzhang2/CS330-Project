            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",
            "output": "NEG",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer mentions negative expressions such as 'nothing happens', 'why write a book' etc), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

A lyrical and beautifully written narrative of the struggle between the local railroad workers' union and their French overseers during a strike against the Dakar-Niger Railroad. Set in 1947 this novel describes a timeless environment which has gone unchanged in post-colonial West Africa. Given the hightened awareness of the plight of Africans today this novel gives a great insight into the history and background of their deprivation and poverty",

I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming.",
