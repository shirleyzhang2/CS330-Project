        "You are given a short poem. The poem is written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. 1st grade to 6th grade kids will be considered as in elementary school. 7th grade to 12th grade kids will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output. An input cannot have both categories at a time."
