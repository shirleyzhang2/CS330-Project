            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

But for the students in my class, it is a special wall. Take a good look at it, and you will get to know the real feelings and thoughts of us, the 9th graders. In the middle of the wall, there is a big \"VICTORY\". It was written in pencil. I guess it must have been written by someone who got a good mark in an exam. A little higher above the formulas, there is a poem. It only has two sentences. It reads: All those sweet memories have disappeared. Like tears dropping in the heavy rain. Oh!

If you \"explore\" the wall more carefully, you will find many other interesting things, like a crying face, or a happy face, and other patterns . There are still some patterns and letters that I can't understand, but they all show the feeling of the students who drew them.

            "input": "Article: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information. Now, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer. Allan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\" Apple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it. And perhaps the most important question is, is my location data with other facts about me?\" \n Question: Why did American lawmakers investigate the use of location-tracking systems on cell-phones? \n (A) Because the systems can store users' information (B) Because many users have suffered loss after using them.

            "input": "Article: \"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers. The answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer: The most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night. While we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust. For a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later. As I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys. When I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died. For a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son. My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\" For the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye. It's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons. First: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me. Second: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital. From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve. \n Question: When he was asked about the most important thing he had done in life at a presentation, the author    _   . \n Options: (A) felt it was not an interesting question (B) thought for a while and spoke his mind (C) gave an answer from a lawyer's point of view (D) didn't give the real answer \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: As the new semester begins, millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper or, more likely, how best to delay that paper. Procrastination is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it. They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space, eating snacks, surfing the Internet, watching videos and looking at other students sitting around them, who, most likely, are doing nothing either. Paralyzed   by their habit to procrastinate, they write micro blogs about their fears, asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue. But this does nothing to break the spell  . According to a recent report, 95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are always procrastinating. The figures are disappointing. Procrastinators are less wealthy, less healthy and less happy than those who don't delay. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior, but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong. Many procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure. Pelling says this is nonsense, as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. The behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel ashamed, inconveniences others and annoys loved ones. Pelling also points out that procrastination feels particularly delinquent  in a society that thinks of speedy action as admirable, and, at times, even as a moral good. Fortunately, social scientists have thrown their weight behind efforts to understand this behavioral mistake and offer strategies to control it. Piers Steel, a Canadian social scientist and author of The Procrastination Equation, believes human is \"designed\" to procrastinate. Nevertheless, he suggests a couple of good ways to get through the task at hand. \n Question: Which behavior belongs to procrastination? \n Options: (A) Never dream away the time. (B) Always complete the tasks ahead of time. (C) Never put off till tomorrow what should be done today. (D) Always wait to work until the \"good mood\" or \"good time\". \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores in certain kinds of tests or even the ability to do well in school. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or anxious situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do. For example, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And, if he can't make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he fails; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook  on life, special feeling about life, and knows how he fits into it. If you look at children, you'll see great difference between what we call \"bright\" children and \"not bright\" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out more about life --- he tries to get in touch with everything around him. But the unintelligent child keeps more to himself and his own dream-world; he seems to have a wall between him and life in general. \n Question: What's the main idea of the passage? \n Options: (A) What's real meaning of intelligence (B) What's the \"bright\" children's behavior (C) What's a special outlook on life (D) How to live and behave in a new situation \n Asnwer: A",
