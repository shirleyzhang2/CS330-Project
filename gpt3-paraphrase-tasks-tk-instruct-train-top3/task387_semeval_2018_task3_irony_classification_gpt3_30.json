    "Definition": [
        "In this task you are given a tweet with irony. Classify the type of irony as \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\". \"Polarity\" is when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" is when a situation fails to meet some expectations. \"Other\" is when the irony is neither polarity nor situational."
