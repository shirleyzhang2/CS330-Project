I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",

Also one of the rubber feet was missing so when it\u2019s placed on the ground the stand digs into the dirt. I rarely leave reviews but this one irritated me because when I contacted the seller I received no response. I\u2019m not expecting to get something special but I at least expect to get what I paid for. I purchased something similar about a year ago from Hola! Music for about $10 more. The Pyle one is much lighter weight and cheaply made (probably why it broke before I even received it). My advice would be to spend the extra $10 and get the one from Hola. \n Category: drugstore",
