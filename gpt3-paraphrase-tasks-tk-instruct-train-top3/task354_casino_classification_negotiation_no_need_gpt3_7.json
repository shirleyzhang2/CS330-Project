    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. no-need is a cooperative negotiation strategy which is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, such as suggesting that they have ample water to spare. This strategy can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
