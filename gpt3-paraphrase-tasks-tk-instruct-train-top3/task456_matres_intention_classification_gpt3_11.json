        "Given a context and a verb separated with a newline character, you need to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, a wish or not. Output 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish, and 'No' otherwise. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition)."
