        "In this task, you will be given a short story of 5 sentences, where the second sentence is missing. You will also be given a candidate sentence for the second sentence. Your task is to determine if the candidate sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it does, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, output \"No\". The candidate sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, such that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
