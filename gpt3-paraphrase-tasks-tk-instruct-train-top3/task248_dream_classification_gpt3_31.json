        "In this task, you will be given a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Matching questions are those that can be answered by exactly one sentence in the dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category, which has the subcategories of summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of the dialogue, such as the topic of the dialogue and the relation between the speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. In arithmetic questions, inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\"."

            "input": "W: What does the term \"alternative energy source\" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.",

You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like? (A) He was pushed by the salesman (B) It was sold at a low price (C) It is the latest fashion.",

It's kind of difficult, but I kind of, I need to talk to you about something. Brandon: Alright. Go ahead. Stacy: Okay. You know, Stephanie. [Yeah.] You're dating my sister, right? Stephanie. [Yeah, yeah.] Um, I think she's back on drugs. Brandon: What do you mean? I, I know she had a problem in the past, but she told me that that was over. Stacy: Well, that's what she says, but you know, I know my sister pretty well; I think I know her better than just about anyone else, and I know you guys have talked about getting married soon, and [Yeah] ... I'm pretty sure she's using drugs again, and you really need to, you need to know this ... you really need to face the facts, and you're going to have to deal with this now. Brandon: So, but, I ... again, how do you know? Stacy: She's doing some of the same stuff, you know, um, like. Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately? Brandon: Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that. Stacy: No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car. Brandon: Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think. Stacy: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it. Brandon: And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it. Stacy: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone .... Brandon: Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean? Stacy: ....Yeah, umm. Brandon: She only has one. Stacy: No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them. Brandon: Ah, man. Stacy: I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this. Brandon: I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know. Stacy: I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ... Brandon: But, she might blow up. Stacy: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ... Brandon: I just don't know. Stacy: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die. Brandon: Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her. Alright. Let, let me thing about it, and I'll call you. [ Okay. ] Alright, thanks. Stacy: Alright. Bye, Brandon., Question: How are Stephanie and Brandon related? (A) Stephanie is Brandon's sister.
