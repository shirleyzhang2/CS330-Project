    "Definition": [
        "Given an object and a part, you need to output 1 or 0 to indicate whether the object has that part as one of its components or not. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts. A '1' output indicates that it does have the barrel as a component, while a '0' output indicates that it does not have the barrel as a component. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
