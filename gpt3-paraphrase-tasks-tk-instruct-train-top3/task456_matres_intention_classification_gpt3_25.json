        "You will receive a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to output 'Yes' if the verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). Otherwise, output 'No'."
