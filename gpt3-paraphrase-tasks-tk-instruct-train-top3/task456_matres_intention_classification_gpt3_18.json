        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated with a newline character. You need to output 'Yes' if the verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. Output 'No' otherwise. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition)."

            "explanation": "In this sentence, the verb is part of of a condition. Therefore, it cannot be known for sure if he is already rebuilding weapons but we have no evidence, or if he will be building weapons in the future, and hence it's not an intention."
