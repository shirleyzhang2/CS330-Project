These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

Since it was our first time, it probably took a bit longer than someone who isn't quite as meticulous but we were able to replace her phone screen just fine, saving her money in the process since we didn't have to go to a mall kiosk.
