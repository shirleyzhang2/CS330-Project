        "Given an utterance from a conversation between a user and an agent, detect the speaker. The user usually commands the agent to schedule events, retrieve event information, and check the schedule. The agent's response is typically an answer to the user's questions or follow-up questions on the user's command. Answer with \"User\" or \"Agent\"."
