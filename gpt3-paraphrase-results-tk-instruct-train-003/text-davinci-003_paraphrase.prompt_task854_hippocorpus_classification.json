If a story is imagined, the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. If a story is recalled, the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. If a story is retold, it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, recalled stories and retold stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas recalled stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in imagined stories. Between recalled and retold stories, retold stories flow significantly more linearly than recalled stories, and retold stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone.",

A retold story is a real memory, like a recalled story, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, a recalled story and a retold story will be similar, in that the writer experienced both of them. An imagined story is more linear in flow and contains more commonsense knowledge, whereas a recalled story is less connected and contains more specific concrete events.

Imagined stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge. Recalled stories are less connected and contain more concrete events.
