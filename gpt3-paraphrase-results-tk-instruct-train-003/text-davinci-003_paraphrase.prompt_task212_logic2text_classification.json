Each category is defined as follows: majority is describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows; unique is describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows; superlative is describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows; ordinal is describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows; comparative is comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column; count is counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows; aggregation is describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows. Additionally, you are given the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: count returns the number of rows in the view; only returns whether there is exactly one row in the view; hop returns the value under the header column of the row; and returns the boolean operation result of two arguments; max/min/avg/sum returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column; nth_max/nth_min returns the n-th max/min of the values under the header column; argmax/argmin returns the row with the max/min value in header column; nth_argmax/nth_argmin returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column; eq/not_eq returns if the two arguments are equal; round_eq returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance; greater/less returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument; diff returns the difference between two arguments; filter_eq/ filter_not_eq returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument; filter_greater/filter_less returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument; filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument; filter_all returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table; all_eq/not_eq returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument; all_greater/less returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument; all_greater_eq/less_eq returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument; most_eq/not_eq returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument; most_greater/less returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument; most_greater_eq/less_eq returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.",
