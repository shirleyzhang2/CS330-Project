        "For a given premise and hypothesis, you will need to determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise. This is based on the principle of entailment, which means that the hypothesis makes sense or follows after the premise. If the hypothesis does not follow the premise but also does not contradict the premise, then it is considered neutral. If the hypothesis clearly contradicts the premise, then it is considered a contradiction.",
