In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively.",

        "Given a hypothesis sentence and an update, you are to output whether the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that speaks of a socially normative behavior. In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively.",
        "Given a hypothesis sentence and an update, you are to determine whether the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement about a socially normative behavior - in other words, a generalization about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides extra information about the situation that could either SUPPORT or UNDERMINE the hypothesis. A supporting context strengthens the hypothesis while an undermining context weakens it. Your task is to output 'strengthener' if the update supports the hypothesis or 'weakener' if the update weakens the hypothesis.",

Strengthener means that the update provides a situation that strengthens the generalization of the hypothesis. Weakener means that the update provides a situation that weakens the generalization of the hypothesis.",

This means that it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update will provide additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context is one that weakens the hypothesis.
