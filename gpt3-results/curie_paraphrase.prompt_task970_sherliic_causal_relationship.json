        "You will be given two sentences, sentence1 and sentence2. You need to decide whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Entail means that the second sentence is in some way implied by the first sentence. For example, if the first sentence is: \"The moon rises everyday\", then the second sentence is: \"Therefore, the moon rises everyday\". Then the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. If you say \"yes\" in this task, then you mean that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. If you say \"no\", then you mean that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Follow the example above, generate a detailed paraphrase for the following without losing information. ",
        "You will receive two sentences sentence1 and sentence2. You must decide whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. If it does entail, output \"yes\", else output \"no\". The task of paraphrasing is to convert a source sentence and a target sentence into another source sentence and target sentence. The paraphrase is a semantically meaningful version of the source sentence. For instance, paraphrasing the original sentence with the paraphrase is the same as making an utterance corresponding to the source sentence. The paraphrase is the same as the paraphrase of the paraphrase. The paraphrase of the paraphrase is the same as the paraphrase of the original sentence. Since the paraphrase of the paraphrase is the same as the original sentence, it is equivalent to the original sentence. Therefore, the paraphrase of the paraphrase is equivalent to the original sentence.",
