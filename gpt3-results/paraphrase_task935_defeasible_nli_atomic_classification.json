    "original_prompt": "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.",

Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. Paraphrase: Given a premise sentence and a hypothesis sentence, you must output the relationship between the statements. It is guaranteed that the relationship is either 'strengthener' or 'weakener'. If the second sentence is the cause of the first one, output 'strengthener'. If the second sentence is the effect of the first one, output 'weakener'. It is guaranteed that the answer is either 'strengthener' or 'weakener'. Original: This task is similar to the reading comprehension tasks that follow, but the test question is a short story. Your task is to output the correct title of the story and the author of the story. You can read the text once and remember the story and the answer to this task at the same time. Paraphrase: Give the title and author of the story that you read. You can read the text once and remember the story and the answer to this task at the same time.

Paraphrase: Give the title of the story and the author of the story that you read. You can read the text once and remember the story and the answer to this task at the same time. The first thing to note about the above paraphrases is that they are all very similar to the paraphrases of the original instructions, with only a small number of changes or additions. The second thing to note is that the paraphrase phrases are much shorter than the original instructions. This is because they are focused on the task at hand and not the program as a whole. The paraphrase will inevitably be shorter than the original instruction, because it is focusing on what you need to do in order to solve the task at hand. Paraphrasing is a popular technique used in the law profession, to the extent that it is referenced in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". The act of paraphrasing has also been used for several centuries by rhetoricians in the study of rhetoric. Though there have been many criticisms of this method of learning, it is a very simple process and requires minimal time to complete. There are several techniques used in paraphrasing. Rhetoricians use paraphrases as a way of sharpening their critical thinking skills.",
