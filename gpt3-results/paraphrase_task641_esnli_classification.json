        "Determine whether the two sentences agree with each other, disagree with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). If the sentences agree with each other, output 'agree'. If the sentences disagree with each other, output 'disagree'. If the sentences are both valid, but not sure what the relationship between them is, output 'neutral'. Original: In this task you're given two statements in Hindi. You must judge whether the second sentence is the cause or effect of the first one. The sentences are separated by a newline character. Output either the word 'cause' or 'effect'. Paraphrase: You will receive two statements in Hindi, separated by a newline character. You need to judge the relationship between the statements. If the second sentence is the cause of the first one, output 'cause'. If the second sentence is the effect of the first one, output 'effect'. It is guaranteed that the answer is either 'cause' or 'effect'. Original: In this task you're given a sentence and two answer options ('A' and 'B'). Your task is to find the correct answer (return the string of the correct option, not 'A' or 'B') for the given question. Paraphrase: Given a sentence and two answer options ('A' and 'B'), return the string of the correct option (not 'A' or 'B') for the given question.

If the second sentence is the cause of the first one, output 'cause'. If the second sentence is the effect of the first one, output 'effect'. It is guaranteed that the answer is either 'cause' or 'effect'. Original: Given two statements, determine whether the second sentence is a true generalization of the first one. The sentences are separated by a newline character. Output either 'true' or 'false'. Paraphrase: Given two statements, you must determine if the second sentence is a true generalization of the first one. If the second sentence is a true generalization of the first one, output 'true'. If the second sentence is not a true generalization of the first one, output 'false'. Original: In this task you're given two statements in Hindi.
