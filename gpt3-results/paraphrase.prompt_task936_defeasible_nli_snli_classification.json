    "original_prompt": "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.",

        "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. A weakening context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis.

Paraphrase: In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. A weakening context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. The following example contains three tasks. The first task, \"Which continent is the country next to the island the country that is the smallest?",
        "You are given a premise sentence, which is a statement that describes a real-world situation.",
        "You are given a premise, which describes a real-world situation, and you are given an hypothesis and an update.",
        "Given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update, the task is to respond to the hypothesis in terms of whether the hypothesis is strengthened or weakened.",
        "Given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update, your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.",
        "You are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update.",
        "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis and an update.",
        "You will receive a premise and a hypothesis, which describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true."
