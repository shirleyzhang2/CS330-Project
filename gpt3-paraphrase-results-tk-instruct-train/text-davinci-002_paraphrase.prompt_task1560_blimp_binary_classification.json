You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task a valid representation of anaphor number agreement should be denoted as 'good' while everything else should be denoted as 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match.",
