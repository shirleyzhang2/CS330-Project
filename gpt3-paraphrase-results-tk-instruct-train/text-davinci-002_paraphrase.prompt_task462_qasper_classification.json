You have to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from a context into a summary while answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences.

        "In this task, you will read a context from an academic paper and answer a question based on that context. There are three possible types of questions: \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", and \"Yes-no\". For an extractive question, the answer is found by taking extracts from the context and putting them together into a summary. For an abstractive question, the answer is found by paraphrasing the context using new sentences. A yes-no question is a question whose expected answer is one of two choices, typically yes or no.",
