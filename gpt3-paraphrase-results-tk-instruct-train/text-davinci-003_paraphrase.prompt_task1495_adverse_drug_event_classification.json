        "The task is to classify medical case reports from MEDLINE as either 'non-adverse drug event' or 'adverse drug event'. Adverse drug reactions are harmful or unpleasant reactions to medical products which may predict danger from future administration and require prevention, a change in dosage, or discontinuation of the product. Your task is to determine if the case reports mention the presence of any adverse drug reactions.",
        "Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Adverse drug reactions are reactions resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products that cause harm or unpleasant experiences and indicate potential danger from future administration. The classification should be either non-adverse drug event or adverse drug event.",
        "Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. An adverse drug reaction is an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. Output 'non-adverse drug event' or 'adverse drug event', depending on whether the case report mentions the presence of an adverse drug reaction or not.",
        "The task is to classify whether a medical case report extracted from MEDLINE mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. An adverse drug reaction is an undesirably harmful or unpleasant reaction to a medical product which could indicate a potential hazard for future administration and require prevention or treatment, or a change in dosage or withdrawal of the product. The classification should be either 'non-adverse drug event' or 'adverse drug event'.",
        "This task requires you to classify medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE. Your task is to determine whether the case report mentions the presence of an adverse drug reaction. An adverse drug reaction is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from the use of medical products which requires prevention, treatment, alteration of dosage, or withdrawal of the product. Your answer should be classified into either non-adverse drug event or adverse drug event.",
        "This task is about classifying medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE into either non-adverse drug event or adverse drug event. Adverse drug reactions are harmful or unpleasant reactions resulting from medical products, predicting hazard from future administration, and warranting prevention or specific treatment, alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. Your task is to determine if the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction.",
        "Given medical case reports taken from MEDLINE, classify the reports as either non-adverse drug events or adverse drug events. Adverse drug reactions are dangerous or unpleasant reactions that come from using medical products, and they predict potential hazards for future use. They may require a change in dosage, prevention, or stopping the use of the product. For the given reports, decide if the case report mentions any adverse drug reaction. Output your answer as either 'non-adverse drug event' or 'adverse drug event'.",
        "Given medical case reports taken from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions an adverse drug reaction or not. An adverse drug reaction is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products.

        "Given medical case reports from MEDLINE, classify the case report as either a 'non-adverse drug event' or an 'adverse drug event'. An 'adverse drug event' is an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from an intervention related to the use of medical products, which predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product. A 'non-adverse drug event' does not involve such reactions.",
        "This task requires you to classify medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE into non-adverse drug event or adverse drug event. An adverse drug reaction is an appreciably harmful or unpleasant reaction caused by the use of a medical product. It predicts potential harm from future administration of the product, necessitating preventative action, a change in dosage, or discontinuation of the product. Your job is to identify whether the case report mentions any adverse drug reaction.",
