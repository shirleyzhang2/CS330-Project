Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
whatever . .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so
no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )
ably captures the dreariness of victorian - era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black - and - white comic .
oscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .
even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .
ians holm ( joe gould 's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians )
log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually was n't half bad .
the film , however , is all good .

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .

the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so
no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )
ably captures the dreariness of victorian - era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black - and - white comic .
oscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .
even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .
ians holm ( joe gould 's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians )
log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually was n't half bad .

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
whatever . .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so
no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
whatever . .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so
no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )
ably captures the dreariness of victorian - era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black - and - white comic .
oscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .
even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .
ians holm ( joe gould 's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians )
log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually was n't half bad .
the film , however , is all good .

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?

Input: films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid ' 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source . if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car / who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so
no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word )
ably captures the dreariness of victorian - era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black - and - white comic .
oscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .

Input: plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive .
they get into an accident .
one of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
what 's the deal ?
watch the movie and "" sorta "" find out . . .
critique : a mind - fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package .
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly
.
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly .
so what are the problems with the movie ?
well , its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled
.
it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you , as an audience member ,
have no idea what 's going on
.
there are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained .
now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film 's biggest problem .
it 's obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ?
not really .
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half - way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still did n't the make the film all that more entertaining .
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
okay , we get it .
. .
there are people chasing her and we do n't know who they are .
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ?
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
there might 've been a pretty decent teen mind - fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
the actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character 's unraveling .
overall , the film does n't stick
because it does n't entertain , it 's confusing , it rarely excites and
it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it .
oh ,
and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
it 's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids .
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since .
whatever . .

Input: Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating “Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.” Unfortunately the writer doesn’t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn’t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that “…!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.” This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing – at a very high level – annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There’s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release.

Input: Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating “Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.” Unfortunately the writer doesn’t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn’t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that “…!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.” This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing – at a very high level – annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There’s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release.

1184,"Task instruction: In this task, you will be given a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, or commonsense. Matching questions are entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in the dialogue, and the answer can be extracted from that same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong in the reasoning category. The summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense subcategories require, respectively, that the whole picture of the dialogue be taken into account, logical reasoning, arithmetic knowledge, or commonsense knowledge in addition to the textual information in the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. ""W"" and ""M"" in the conversations stand for ""woman"" and ""man"".(1)

(C) The movie will not be shown.

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.

Input: M: What do you think of my new sweater? W: Well, it looks nice, but why don't you put it on, and then I'll tell you if it suits you? M: Okay. You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like? (A) He was pushed by the salesman (B) It was sold at a low price (C) It is the latest fashion.

1186,"Task instruction: In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into matching, summary, logic, arithmetic and commonsense groups. Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. In arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group.(1)

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.

You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping.

M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping.

1201,"Task instruction: In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Matching questions are entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in the dialogue, and the answer can be extracted from that sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong in the reasoning category, which is further divided into the subcategories summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Answering summary questions requires an understanding of the whole dialogue, including the topic and the relation between the speakers. Logical reasoning is required to answer logical questions. Inferring the answer to arithmetic questions requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, in addition to the textual information in the dialogue, additional commonsense knowledge is required that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can belong to more than one group. ""W"" and ""M"" in the conversations stand for ""woman"" and ""man"".(1)

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract.

You should categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Matching questions are those that can be answered by exactly one sentence in the dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. The summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense subcategories require answering questions that need the whole picture of the dialogue, logical reasoning, arithmetic knowledge, and commonsense knowledge, respectively. Note that a question can be in more than one group.(1)

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.

Input: W: What does the term ""alternative energy source"" mean? M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man? (A) Coal burnt daily for the comfort of our homes. (B) Anything that can be used to produce power. (C) Fuel refined from oil extracted from underground.

Input: M: What do you think of my new sweater? W: Well, it looks nice, but why don't you put it on, and then I'll tell you if it suits you? M: Okay. You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like? (A) He was pushed by the salesman (B) It was sold at a low price (C) It is the latest fashion.
