A matching question is one that is entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in the dialogue, and the answer can be extracted from that sentence. A question that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence is a reasoning question. The summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense subcategories are defined as follows: Answering a summary question requires the whole picture of the dialogue, such as the topic of the dialogue and the relation between the speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer a logical question. In an arithmetic question, inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer a commonsense question, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".",
