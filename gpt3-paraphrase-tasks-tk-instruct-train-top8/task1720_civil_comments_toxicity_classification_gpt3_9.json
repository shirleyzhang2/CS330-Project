Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

I was once given a clinical diagnosis of Lyme and the treatments didn't do anything to my symptoms. A long story short, it turned out that the problem was nothing more than Sleep Apnea. Unfortunately, the Lyme doctor, along with several other medical practitioners including naturopaths, allopaths, cardiologists and an endocrinologist even considered or mentioned it. It stayed under their radar. \n\nA friend of mine who thought he had Lyme asked his doctor about Sleep Apnea and the doctor said to him \"Oh you don't look like you have Sleep Apnea\" which is like saying \"Oh you don't look like you have Type O Blood.\" Totally incorrect. Sleep Apnea can be only diagnosed with a Sleep Study and its worth getting if only to rule it out as a causative factor. Turned out my friend has severe Sleep Apnea and using a CPAP machine has given him his life back. \n\nSame with me. I doubt if I ever had Lyme!",
