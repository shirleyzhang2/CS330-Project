    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence, you will need to judge the quality of the sentence by indicating \"Good\" or \"Bad\". A sentence is considered to be of good quality if it is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors. If a sentence does not meet these criteria, then it is considered to be of bad quality."
