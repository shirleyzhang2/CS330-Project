    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two sentences in the English language and your task is to classify them into one of their discourse types. There are 13 discourse types in total, which are 'SINGLE_S_COORD', 'SINGLE_CATAPHORA', 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER', 'SINGLE_APPOSITION', 'SINGLE_VP_COORD', 'SINGLE_CONN_START', 'PAIR_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN', 'SINGLE_RELATIVE', 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER_ANAPHORA', 'SINGLE_S_COORD_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN_ANAPHORA' and 'PAIR_NONE'. A discourse type is an indicator to classify the given two sentences on the basis of a co-text as well as a relevant context."
