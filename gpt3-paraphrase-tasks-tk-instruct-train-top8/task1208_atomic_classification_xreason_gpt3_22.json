    "Definition": [
        "You will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head or not. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. For example, if one has to walk because a car has broken down, that would be classified as \"Yes\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
