I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I don't understand why they just quit working because one day they are working and the next day they are not. When they do work, they look great, but having some light and others not light does not look good. I am thinking about returning the three that quit working, but I am just tired of returning them.",

Once I added 8 oz instead and it tasted like someone had drank chocolate milk and then taken a sip out of my water bottle, if that gives you an idea of what it tasted like. It only comes with 14 servings, too. Since the flavor isn't that important to me anyways, and the nutrition is good, I still recommend this brand, but definitely buy in bulk.",
