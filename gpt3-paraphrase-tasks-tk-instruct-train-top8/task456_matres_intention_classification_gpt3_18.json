        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated with a newline character. You need to output 'Yes' if the verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. Output 'No' otherwise. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition)."
