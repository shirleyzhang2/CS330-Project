            "input": "(CNN) Can tall tales swing an election? That's the question being asked today in conference rooms across the digital media industry. After Donald Trump's startling presidential victory, many are wondering if an abundance of misleading or simply made up news stories gave President-elect Trump the edge he needed to win. Critics are calling on media companies to regulate the spread of phony news reports. Already, platforms like Facebook and Google have announced plans to curtail fake news by revising their algorithms and user policies. But will such changes really improve the trustworthiness of online news? First, some perspective: The 2016 election was a stunningly low-turnout race, which ended in an ambiguous, electoral-but-not-popular victory for President-elect Trump. Fake news may have been, at most, a necessary but insufficient cause for the election's outcome. Take away one FBI press conference, or add a last-minute Clinton rally in Wisconsin, and things might have gone very differently. If fake news did move the needle in Trump's favor, it was only one of many factors affecting the outcome of a race between two of the least popular candidates of all time.Brian Hughes: Make no mistake. Fake news is a problemThe solution to this problem isn't less content, writes Hughes, it's better curation \n Questions:Social media like _ work best when they're effectively monopolies.
