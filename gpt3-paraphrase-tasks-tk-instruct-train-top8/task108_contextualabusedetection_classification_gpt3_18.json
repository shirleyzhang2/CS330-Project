        "You will be given a text. If the text contains any abusive content, indicate \"yes\". Otherwise, indicate \"no\". We consider the content to be abusive if it contains any of the following instances: (1) Identity Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which contains a negative statement made against an identity. An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation) (2) Affiliation Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which express negativity against an affiliation. We define affiliation as a (more or less) voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors).) (3) Person Directed Abuse (e.g., Content which directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language.) and (4) Counter Speech (e.g., Content which challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others.).

I had some issues to deal with (legit, actual, natural disaster related shit) and I told the other mods I needed a few days off.  So, I missed the build up.  But, I came back to find a mod queue with almost 100 reports needing attention.  I went through about forty of them and noted they were all leg humping related and user-on-user drama...so, I quickly typed up that post telling people how they could be their own superhero and mute people that pissed them off.     In my opinion and experience, we were pretty hands off and used to only get involved if the report was blatantly in violation of the rules.  Because, frankly, the rules were pretty subjective.  Personally, I only ever removed six comments in my tenure as mod.  Most of the time, I just wrote a quick note to the person who was reported and the reporter to say \"hey, guys...as a reminder, please...fill in the blank\".  That worked for months!  Then,  there was this sort of gang mentality that arose and the reports got petty and no one wanted to discuss anything. They just wanted to name and shame and started attacking each other. It was stupid. But, as I said, good luck to anyone modding that forum and I wish them well because it's quite a task.",
