            "input": "I respectfully disagree that we should stand by idly as parents abdicate this very important responsibility. In an age of internet porn, young people can easily seek to satisfy their curiosity and be exposed to very perverted conceptions of human sexuality. Even if they don't view pornography, they can develop very skewed perceptions of human sexuality from primetime media and Hollywood movies. A more clinical curriculum with opportunities to ask real questions and have them answered without shame seems crucial for all young people, not just those lucky enough to grow up with informed and open parents willing to address the issues over the course of a child's development. I'd say the same for immunizations or other public health issues or if families decided that they only wanted their sons and not their daughters educated. But I think we absolutely agree that families need to accept a more active role, speaking early and often about sexuality, as young bodies gradually change.",
