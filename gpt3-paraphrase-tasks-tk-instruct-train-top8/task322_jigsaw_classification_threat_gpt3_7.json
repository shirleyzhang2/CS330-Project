The biggest issue was people were being immediately released on OR and would go out and immediately re offend. SB91 does not save money it just transferred the costs to citizens in the form being victimized, insurance costs and loss of property that is not covered by insurance. That in addition to human costs from being assaulted or being released immediately after committing a crime and being ran over by a truck and getting killed like in Fairbanks. The state is also seeing more vigilante type behavior by frustrated citizens. SB91 is a loser.  That and the fact we received no training on the new changes outside of a memo. Lots of confusing aspects for law enforcement on SB91.",

At first it seems inappropriate to use such a word in reference to this nut-bar tyrant but it is psychologically the right move to publicly give Kim face saving leeway to have a diplomatic meeting. At the same time the US constantly reminds them that military action is being prepared.",

Notice how all these newspapers are hugely unprofitable yet they keep pumping out their lies and propaganda which shows they are just propaganda tools for the elite. Even if the Toronto Star went bankrupt some corrupt globalist billionaire would just bail them out to ensure that the brainwashing and moral corruption of Canadians continues.",
