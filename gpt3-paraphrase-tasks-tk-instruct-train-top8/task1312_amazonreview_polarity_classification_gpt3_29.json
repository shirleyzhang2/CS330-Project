I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

Strangely, the first cartridge is fine, but the second one cannot be accepted by the printer. I've tried other cartridges to ensure that it is only this one that is faulty. Every time I try to install, printer tells me to \"remove and replace to insure proper installation.\" Again, it's not my printer. It's just the ONE cartridge. Bummer. Ink isn't cheap. Furthermore, the return window closed (it's been exactly a month), and of course I couldn't have known that the 2nd cartridge wouldn't work until now. I feel Amazon should replace with a working cartridge under these circumstances, but apparently it's too late. Crummy.",
