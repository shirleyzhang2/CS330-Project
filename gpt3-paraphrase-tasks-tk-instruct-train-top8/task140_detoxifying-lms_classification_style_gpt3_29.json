    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions, select the completion that has the most similar style to the prompt. Style is defined as the tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure. If a prompt is colloquial, the completion should also be colloquial, as opposed to a completion that is encyclopedic or formal."
