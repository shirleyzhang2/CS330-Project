    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is most similar in style to the prompt. Style is defined as the tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure throughout the prompt-completion pair. If a prompt is colloquial, then the completion should also be colloquial, as opposed to a completion that is encyclopedic or overly formal. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
