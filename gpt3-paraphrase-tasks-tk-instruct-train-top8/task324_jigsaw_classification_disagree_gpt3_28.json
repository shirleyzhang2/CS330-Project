    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Disagree means that the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Agree means that the comment is not likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

It is just that he, like many others who have never had to start a business or find a job or save for retirement, has no practical experience at what it is to be middle class.  I know many people who make over $100k/year but without pensions.  None are \"rich\" and all are going to be working a long time because they are still paying off mortgages in their late 40's/early 50's.  Now that they are finally in a place where they are making good money, they are being told they are the problem in the country - they are rich and aren't paying enough taxes.\nMeanwhile, the government paid $200k for artwork on the cover of the 2017 budget, which is the federal tax paid by someone who makes $700k/year.  Get rid of wasteful practices instead of more revenue to continue wasteful practices.",

There is a Tim Horton's in the building where my son's condo is located, and every time we decide to meet there for a coffee, there is almost NEVER any table available. You can go by hours later and the many of the same people are there. Given limited seating, often one person is taking a table/booth for four. \n\nIt must be a real dilemma for shop owners and truly a balancing act. I have left a coffee shop where there is no seating and tried to find another one or simply didn't buy. It has to hurt business when purchasing one coffee makes customers feel they can stay for hours.",
