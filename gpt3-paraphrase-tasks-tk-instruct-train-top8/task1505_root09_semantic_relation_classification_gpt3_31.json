    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a pair of words. You need to deduce the type of relationship between them, which can be one of 'HYPER', 'COORD', or 'RANDOM'. 'HYPER' means that the first word is a specific instance of the second word. 'COORD' means that the first word and the second word belong to the same semantic class. If neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
