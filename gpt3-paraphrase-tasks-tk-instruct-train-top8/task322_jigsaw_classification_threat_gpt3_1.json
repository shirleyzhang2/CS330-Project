And, as more immigrants come from non-European countries, their perceptions and reactions will become more publicized.  You ever see the recent charts on immigration demographics of recent?  Much, much different than what it was 40 years ago.\n\nYou're definitely civil.  My bet is it's some Raiders fans.  We need to keep an eye on those types....",

I hope Bell successfully sues the CRTC for stupidity and Blais pays out of his pension.",
