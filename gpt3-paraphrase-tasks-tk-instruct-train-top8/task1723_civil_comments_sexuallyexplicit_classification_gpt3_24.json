But the indigenous Hawaiian still suffers from unemployment and homelessness.  Bill Aila had a chance to make some headway into solving some of these problems while he was the Director of the DLNR.  A job given to Mr. Aila as a appeasement for his failed bid to become governor of Hawaii.  Aila failed so he was made deputy director at Hawaiian Homes. I would ask that you look into the fact that there are no, zero, native Hawaiians that work as fishermen in the commercial long line industry.  Hundreds of jobs catching Hawaiian fish are being taken by person unlawfully fishing.  These are jobs that can get Hawaiian back to work immediately.  Not a lot of training required and if paid properly can be a living wage.  Look into this situation and if appropriate speak this this issue.  You voice is clearly heard and respect by many.  Thanks.",

Its good for promotion points don't you know. However, the Purple Heart is not among them. So, what scars? Using a P-38 can opener on his C-rations can?
