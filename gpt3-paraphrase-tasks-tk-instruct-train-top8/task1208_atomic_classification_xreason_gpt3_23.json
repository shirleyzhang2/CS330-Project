        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants.

You have to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head or not. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
