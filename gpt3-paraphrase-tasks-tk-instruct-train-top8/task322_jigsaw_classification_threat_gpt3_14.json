Ultimately, whether or not something is accurate and truthful depends upon careful review, analysis and interpretation of evidence over a significant period of time.\n\nMany people (and organizations) do not recognize when they make assumptions or make statements or they engage in behavior that is perceived by a minority group as hurtful or hostile toward their community.  Instead of constantly telling us that the JBS always expels racists and anti-semites (which is false) you might (just once) acknowledge that the JBS has welcomed racists and anti-semites into its ranks as chapter leaders, as Coordinators, as National Council members, as authors and as speakers.  That simply is indisputable.\n\nFurthermore, the JBS circulated arguments that originated with bigots -- such as their attack on Highlander Folk School and Martin Luther King Jr.",
