        "Given an object and a part, you need to decide if the object has that part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts. The answer should be 1 or 0, 1 means the object has the given part, while 0 means it doesn't have the part."
