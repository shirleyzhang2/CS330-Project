Yesterday I took my car back to Juve Auto Clinic as the rotor on the front right side was showing groves. They did an inspection and found the brake pad was faulty and because the pad was warranted they replaced both the rotor and the pad at no cost to me. They take good care of their customers!!  They sell only the best parts which have warranties on them.  They were polite and made sure the part was delivered in under an hour as they knew I had an appointment.  The staff is friendly and polite and you feel total trust in having them work on your car.  If you need any kind of car repair definitely consider JUVE AUTO CLNIC.  I still recommend them without reservation!!",

The listings for Pandora is rather confusing in that they're all on the strip and not labeled which on LVB. \\n\\nI got started on Pandora because I got a gift and I can't have a unfinished bracelet, but once it's done, I don't want anymore. 2 reasons - I'm not quite happy with how the bracelets fit as I'm a inbetween size and simply because of the service at this Pandora and Jared (an authorized Pandora retailer) sucks and I don't want to hassle with either while spending money. It's not cheap and I'm not quite happy with what I own either. How shitty is that? To have about $250 worth on product on your wrist that you are just okay with. \\n\\nThe main reason isn't because they aren't acting nice, but they dodge trying to fix my problem if the problem is solved by a return or exchange and try to upsell. This last time the BF got me a 2nd bracelet to balance out the charms on leather (since you can't wear too many on those compared to metal) and I wanted one smaller so they stack better. I wasnt happy, but the smaller size was too small. They kept trying to sell me on these clips that hold two bracelets in place, but the designs were ugly and I kept having to decline  it and oblige them to put it on my bracelet so I can tell them I don't like how it looks again. So since I wouldn't they just said I should keep it and regift it if I don't like it. Erm, I find that to be so wrong to regift something that my boyfriend gave me. I find that actually pretty rude to say. I sat on it for a few days and asked the BF to just return it since it was sold to him and they were rather pouty about him doing a return and trying to get him to keep it. He already doesn't like this location because when he was trying to buy said bracelet and charms, the lady would not stop trying to upsell him to gold charms and colored charms and was not listening to what he was asking for. He got me something else that's non Pandora. The vibe is so forced. I get sales, I was in retail and had sales goals, but I never made people feel awkward or upsell when people clearly weren't into it. \\n\\nWaah. No bueno.",

When we went on a friday night, there were only about 7 tables occupied, with my friend and I sitting alone at the sushi bar.\\n\\nWe came here because we wanted sushi and rolls.  None of the pittsburgh restaurants seem to specialize very much in rolls, and of the sushi restaurants near shadyside/oakland, this one seemed to offer the most number of rolls (please let me know if you know of other ones nearby that offer more!)  We got a 12 piece combination sushi platter, a kim's favorite roll (which actually seemed like two separate rolls totaling 16 pieces), and a spider roll.  While the sushi and rolls were of acceptable size, the fish was definitely not very fresh.  the spider roll was probably one of the most repulsive rolls i've tasted in a while.  the soft shell crab was fried beyond recognition, and it took too much effort to chew as the crunching resounded loudly within my head.\\n\\nMy friend and I also split a soon doo boo, which came with a bowl of rice and a few miniplates of banchan.  while the soon doo boo was acceptable, with a lot of tofu inside, the banchan was pretty underwhelming. broccoli, pretty weak kimchi, bean sprouts...\\n\\nand sadly our bill came out to be way too much for a regular sushi dinner. after tax and tip, my friend and i each paid ~35.  while the service was friendly, i will probably not be coming back here again.",

            "input": "I've tried this place once, and did not have a good experience.\\n\\nBRGR bills itself as, \\\"\"Pittsburgh's first gourmet burger bar\\\"\".  Well, first of all, you might argue that Tessaro's, BRGR's competition located in an adjacent neighborhood, is Pittsburgh first \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\" (I hate that term, so overused) burger joint - predating BRGR by a couple of decades.  Secondly, for a restaurant that bills itself as a \\\"\"first\\\"\", you might wonder why they chose a non-novel name - the very same abbreviation is used as the name of several \\\"\"high-end\\\"\" burger restaurants in NYC, Kansas, and Texas.  \\n\\nSo let's talk about the \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\" burgers served at BRGR.  I don't really understand why they describe their burgers as \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\", as nothing is noteworthy about the meat used to make their burgers.  In every other \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\" burger restaurant that I've been to in other cities, I noticed that the restaurant had gone to great lengths to describe the locally-raised, grass-fed beef that went into their freshly-ground burgers.  BRGR never mentions the source, feed, or freshness of its burger meat.  \\n\\nUpon tasting the burger, you quickly understand why - the burger is made from everyday commercially-raised meat.  It doesn't taste like anything particularly special.  It's a reasonably good burger - just nothing special.  It isn't anywhere near as good as Tessaro's - which is about the same price (for the burger alone, more to continue).\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered both ordinary potato fries and sweet potato fries with our burgers.  The sweet potato fries were inedible - limp, wet, and oil-laden.  A single fry, lifted by two fingertips at its end, would double back on itself under its own weight.  We told the server that they were inedible and sent them back uneaten.  The potato fries were edible, just not very good - they were soft, undercooked (a soft yellow, without any crust that you expect in a good fry) and disappointing.  A \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\" burger joint ought to be able to serve a proper french fry: par-fried first at a lower temperature to first cook the interior creating big pillowy granules of fluffy starch, then flash-fried to order at a high temperature, properly caramelizing the exterior leaving the fry with a delicious tasty crust.  This isn't hard folks - I can do it in my own kitchen - why can't a self-professed \\\"\"gourmet\\\"\" restaurant do it in a professional kitchen?\\n\\nThe service during our visit was awful.  I was unfamiliar with a beer on the draft list and asked what type of beer it was.  Our server said, \\\"\"I don't know\\\"\" and stared at me.  I asked her to find out.  When she returned, I was told, \\\"\"It's a kind of a dark-type of a beer\\\"\".  Yikes.  Our server then proceeded to bring the wrong beer - and told us, \\\"\"I'm sorry, I was talking to my friends and forgot which beer you ordered\\\"\".  Yikes.  She also didn't deduct the inedible sweet potato fries from the order, until we reminded her.  All in all, she was a human conveyor belt - without knowledge, charm, or any detectable interest in her work.  It was way below par.\\n\\nThe atmosphere isn't to my taste - it has the look and feel of a high-end sports bar, with plasma TVs blaring sports entertainment from virtually every wall/corner.  There are a few plush-looking leather couches, likely remnants from the space's past life as a high-end cocktail bar, but I think you're paying for them.\\n\\nMeaning, the prices are too high.  The burgers themselves seem reasonable ($6-$13, average over $8.50) - until you see that they do not come with any sides, which cost extra ($4 for fries, $5 for onion rings).  Draft beer is expensive - over half of the draft selections were in the $6.5 to $8.5 range for a pint of beer!  Dinner for two (two burgers, two sides, four beers) was over $57 - before a $4 fry was removed from the tab.  \\n\\nAll in all BRGR simply isn't worth the price.  If you want a far better burger, for a far better value, you're far better off going two miles away to Tessaro's.",
