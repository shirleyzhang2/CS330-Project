        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or if it contains language that is considered taboo in polite usage."

I find this unconscionable especially when the specialists charge you $250 for a 5 min. visit, whereas my GP charges half that for a 20 minute+ meeting.  These are NOT anomalous numbers, either.  The specialists in this town make a killing, and we're all paying for it.",
