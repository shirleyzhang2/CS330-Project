Paris and Brussels have strict gun control. And Chicago, gun murder capital of the USA, has strict gun control. If making guns illegal would cause criminals to stop using guns, then we could stop murder by simply make it illegal to murder people. Oh, wait, I guess we already have that law on the books.

Not a very impressive statement from the 'director'.\n\nAny opinion from the DOJ is just that, opinion.  The DOJ is not the Court and personally I believe it is currently run by unconstitutional criminals.\n\nTeam participation is a deflection of the real issue here.  The real issue is does a penis = male and a vagina = female or is a mental dysphoria  of sexuality brought on by societal pressures the determining factor.  The second part being,  whose 'feelings' or rights are more important, the less than 3% or the 97%?\n\nPersonally I like to drive fast, over the speed limit and have never hurt anyone or crashed.  My guess, way more than 3% of drivers agree.  Therefore I should be 'allowed' to because I 'feel' like it.\nDoes that offend you?  Is it potentially uncomfortable or unsafe to the vast majority?  Can I legally do it?  No!  What is the difference?  Morals!",

Hitler's propaganda machine headed by a newspaper man, Goebbels, spewed out the same drumbeat and faux facts as Fox News or The Rushbo does for the last 16 yrs.  We will get the government we deserve unless some of our voters actually get their news from any other sources than Fox or Newsmax.
