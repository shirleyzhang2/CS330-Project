        "In this task, you will see an English sentence. You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. An anaphor is an expression whose interpretation depends upon another expression. Anaphor number agreement is when a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression in terms of plurality: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task, a valid representation of an anaphor number agreement should be called 'good', while everything else should be called 'bad'. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match in terms of plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match."
