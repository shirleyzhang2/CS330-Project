        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is cooperative and is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item. It implies that the item is up for grabs and can directly benefit the opponent."
