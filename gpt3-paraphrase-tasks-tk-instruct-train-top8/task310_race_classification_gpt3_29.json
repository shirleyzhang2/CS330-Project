            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

But I had to overcome the true challenge!     Luckily, I met seven new friends, six boys and one girl. They were really nice and I loved their company. We hung out most weekends. We cooked, watched movies, chatted and shared jokes! It was amazing -- until something unexpected happened !     One of my friends was diagnosed with kidney   stones which needed to be removed as soon as possible. But our friend could not afford the surgery. He tried to get help from our other friends but they refused him. My heart cried for him! Our friends abandoned him just when he needed them most.     I didn't know how to help him because I didn't have any money either. But I never lost hope. Instead I tried to think of other options. I told him not to worry because he might find a way somehow and everything would be all right.     So I went to the hospital with him. I talked to the surgeon, asking him to do the surgery for him and promising to pay the expenses the next day (As if I had that money). I must have been convincing because the surgeon agreed to do it! Now, how was I going to get that much money?     All I knew was that I needed to help my friend! I tried to borrow money from other friends but I failed. I tried selling my things but no one wanted them. Then I had to talk to my boss. I asked him if I could have my next two months salary in advance -- without even thinking on how I would survive for two months without money.     He was surprised and asked me why. I told him that I had a friend who was really in need.  Luckily, he gave my two months salary without hesitation! As soon as I had the money I ran to the hospital and paid all the bills.     Friendship may not only be found in happy moments. Sometimes you can find it on the toughest time in your life! \n Question: Why did the author go to the hospital with his friend? \n Options: (A) To find free medical treatment for his friend.

The University of Melbourne study shows that people who use the Internet for their own reasons at work are about 9 percent more productive  than those who do not. Study author Brent Coker said, \"Surfing the Internet at times helps increase workers' attention.\" \"People need to relax for a bit to get back their attention,\" Coker said on the university's website. \"Having a short break, such as a quick surfing of the Internet, helps the mind to rest itself, leading to a higher total Internet attention for a day's work, and as a result, increases productivity  ,\" he said. According to the study of 300 workers, 70 percent of people who use the Internet at work surf the Internet for their own reasons during office hours. Among the most popular surfing activities are searching for information about products, reading online news, playing online games and watching videos. \"Firms spend a lot of money on software to _ their workers from watching videos, using social networking sites or shopping online,\" said Coker. \"That's not always a good idea.\" However, Coker said the study looked at people who surfed the Internet in moderation , or were on the Internet for less than 20 percent of their total time in the office. \"Those who spend too much time surfing the Internet will have a lower productivity than those without.\" he said. \n Question: What does the University of Melbourne study mainly show? \n Options: (A) People who surf the Internet are good workers.

            "input": "Article: In the US and Britain, the slogan around colleges was \"Save water. Shower with a friend.\" Now, Wuhan University has come up with another system for the campus bathhouse. It charges students for the amount of time in a shower. Before entering the bathhouse, students pay for the amount of time they want in the shower with cash or their student ID card. The clock starts ticking the minute the tape is turned on. It pauses when a button is pressed for soap. An integrated circuit (IC) card reader at each tap shows the time. No money, no water. The benefits of the new system can be seen with the old system, which charged 1 Yuan for each person regardless of time in the shower. The university used about 320 tons of water daily under the old system, but only 160 tons now. Many students use the new system but opinions on it are divided. Some students say it is bad because bathing had become a sort of race. Many people using it for the first time are not sure how long they need to shower. Some might be embarrassed if their time is up and they're still covered in soap. They have to ask the bathhouse worker to help them buy extra time. \"It's a _ in the system that you can not buy extra time on the ID card,\" said Ren, a freshman in Wuhan University. The university is also considering some students' suggestions that they be allowed to pay after they've finished the shower. Not surprisingly, some are complaining about losing the hour shower. But many students say the move helps them develop a water-saving sense. Without the time limits, most students tended to shower for 30 to an hour in the bathhouse. Some even used the hot water to wash their clothes. \"In my experience, 10--20 minutes is enough,\" said Dai Zhihua, a third-year student who usually takes 8 minutes. A similar system has been installed in other universities. Shanghai Normal University introduced it at its Fengxiang Campus in September. The bathing fee there is 0.2 Yuan per minute. One male student responded by setting a record with a two-minute shower. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true? \n Options: (A) Students buy the time of their showers. (B) The clock times the student's bathing except when the bather pauses for soap. (C) If money runs out, there will be no water.

            "input": "Article: Focus on class     SOME US parents are sad that their high school children score badly in math , science and reading compared to kids in other countries.    There has been an endless series of mostly fruitless education reforms to address this gap ( ).    Now comes an approach based on the insights  of a group of US exchange students. They spent a year in some of the most successful high schools in the world -in Finland, Poland and South Korea.    Author and journalist Amanda Ripley followed three exchange students for her new book, The Smartest Kids in the World - and How They Got That Way. She argues that to improve academics, US schools should de-emphasize sports.    Instead, students should bring their passion and intensity  to academics , she concludes.    \"High school in Finland, Korea and Poland had a purpose, just like high school football practice in America,\" she writes. \"There was a big , important contest at the end, and the score counted.\"   Sports are a distraction  ,Ripley argues, and most countries require them to take place outside of school.    Trading in US school sports culture would be a huge change for people in the US , who respect teamwork and sportsmanship as training for life.    But playing down sports could pay off, as it has elsewhere, if we redirect money , focus and glory to learning.    Ripley is critical  of memorization in South Korean education, but she praises the system's high goals and the free-dom its students have to fail and recover through hard work.    Too often , we don't ask teachers to give our kids harder assignments  -and we're quick to complain about a failing grade. What's working elsewhere is to set ambitious  goals for kids ,and then allow them to discover that they have it within themselves to reclaim  success from failure.   Each of the countries in Smartest Kids came to education reform after an economic crisis  . Finland was losing jobs after graduating just 10 percent of its teens from high school in the 1950s. Today , the graduation rate is 95 percent . Poland's wakeup came in 1999, as students consistently tested below average in reading.    We've tried so many \"reforms\" in education. Maybe what we need is a truly radical  shift away from sports in favor of schooling. \n Question: Which of the following statements about education in South Korea is True according to the article? \n Options: (A) High academic scores are considered an important measure of education quality in South Korea. (B) The memorization skills of South Korean students are the keys to their academic success. (C) South Korean teachers emphasize teamwork and sportsmanship as much as American teachers do. (D) South Korea started education reforms in the 1950s to improve students' reading skills. \n Asnwer: A",

She recalled. \"That's what I wanted to do that day,\" said Kathryn, who is now 23 years old. And in the future, she continued to do art as a hobby. Recently, Kathryn was named Lake Placid's first artist in the neighborhood. She will be there for at least four weeks and possibly more. During that time, she will teach an art class and focus on her own art. Much of her work includes creating photos. She said: \"There is always something there that you haven't included, so you can never stop when painting a photo.\" Kathryn ended up as the first artist just by chance. She said her sister was on vacation in Florida and looking for a job in Lake Placid. The sister got the job and moved there. Kathryn said she visited her sister and was ordered to do wall paintings inside a building. Later, her sister saw a demand for an artist on line and suggested she should apply. Kathryn said she's the first artist in her family, but added that her parents are creative. Her father loves to create things from wood, she said. \"Anything you can make out of wood, he has made it,\" she said. Her own creativity with art continued through college. While at college, she was once employed to recreate a photo of a couple on a vacation to Florida and one of a sunset in either North Carolina or South Carolina.

Roll with it,\" my husband, Lonny, says, \"It's going to be like this for a while.\" He is right. It's likely that life will continue to go forward before it slows down. But I remembered the still, quiet days that our family used to enjoy. I missed long walks through the park when we held the boys' little hands. I longed for  lazy Saturday afternoons under the tree in our backyard. I wanted to slip back a few years, when busyness was the exception and not the rule. One night, after a particularly full day and evening games, our family gathered on the porch for ice cream. Two parents, two teens, and three small boys piled on one old swing and a couple of rocking chairs. We were together, in one place, for a small slice of time. The moon was full. The Mississippi River, flowing past our home, was smooth as glass. I wrapped my own arms around the son who sat on my lap and breathed deeply to _ his little-boy scent --dirt and sweat. My heart was still and content . I realized that while crazy is our new normal happiness is as usual.

It occurred to me that this may not be the most dignified posture for a Buddhist nun . I had seen the old lady from the seat in front of me as she walked up and down the passage with a flashlight. I asked a few times what was wrong, but she didn't answer at first --- she couldn't hear me. She was wearing a woolen coat. Judging from her accent, she came from Eastern Europe. Do you know what hearing aids cost? Thousands, especially for the new tiny hidden-in-the-ear type she described. It takes a long time for an appointment to make a new one, and many doctor visits to get the thing adjusted right. Therefore, my dignity seemed less important than finding that hearing aid. But how does one find a tiny black object in a shadowy jet cabin ? The lady wasn't even sure where or when she had lost it. At one point, a couple of flight attendants did a random search around the lady's seat; I wasn't impressed. They left suggesting that she search the seat of her previous flight! My flashlight turned up all kinds of small objects, bits of plastic, broken pieces of headphones. The old lady said that she gave up. Yet I couldn't. After we landed, as passengers streamed past us, I insisted that the lady move aside while awaiting her wheelchair. Then I got into a real down and dirty search among the dust under her seat and on the floor. Look! A little peanut-sized shiny black object caught the light of my flashlight in a floor crack near her seat. What a rush. \"I found it!\" With great astonishment and gratitude, the old lady responded, \"I haven't the words to express my thanks!\" \n Question: Why did the author put her hands and knees on the floor? \n Options: (A) She is a religious Buddhist nun.

If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things.So it silently began to pay attention to your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. Hunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through extensive reading.Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to get help from reading.You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all, your \"How to?\" questions.Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but even your mind decodes   it and explains it to you.The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.The same seed if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would never have thought in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity.The larger number of books you read, your mind will open up like never before.Also this improves your speaking skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary.Within no time you start speaking English or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time. Actually, I had a problem in sped king English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly.I am still on the path of improvement.So, give food to your thoughts by reading. \n Question: Why are we humans the most developed of all living beings? \n Options: (A) We have desires to climb the steps of evolution.
