As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

The show was outstanding and a pleasure to see on stage, but I have read many reviews that criticize this newest film adaptation. I strongly disagree! This special addition DVD delighted my entire family. I am very impressed with this movie version and highly reccommend it. Its depiction of the POTO story is evocatively romantic and the music is a \"perfect\" score. The special additions reveal just what lengths Andrew Lloyd Webber, director Joel Schumacher and their  collaborators went through to finally achieve this production. It also contains the evolution of the POTO stage show as well as the movie. Gerard Butler is the ultimate Phantom and I was enchanted with his singing.  If you love captivating music and romantic movies - buy this DVD",

            "input": "Two cute girls and a plan gone awry . I justed watched SAMARITAN GIRL tonight.  This Korean film, directed by Kim Ki-Duk, features Ji-Min Kwak as Yeo-jin, a high school girl who runs a small prostitution business with her friend Jae-young (played by the cute as a button Yeo-reum Han, acting here under the name Min-jeong Seo, according to Imdb.)    These two girls are best friends and seem to do everything together.  To raise money so they can fly to Europe, Jae-young comes up with the prostitution idea.  She sleeps with the clients and actually enjoys it, while Yeo-jin makes the arrangements and keeps the money.  Things go bad one day when two cops follow Jae-young up to her liaison in a motel, and attempting to escape, jumps from the window to her death.    Yeo-jin is distraught at the loss of her best friend and beset with guilt over having the money entrusted to her.  To alleviate her conscience, she arranges liaisons with Jae-young's clients to give back the money.  However, when her father, a cop on the vice squad, discovers what she's up to, things take a dark turn for both himself and his daughter's customers.    This film seemed like several in one.  It starts off as a story about the friendship of two school girls, turns into a tale of about guilt and redemption, and then turns into a story about revenge and a lack of communication.  I'd like to have seen more of the friendship (with more screen time for Yeo-reum Han), and some things seem rather far-fetched, but it's a thought provoking film and I liked it overall.    The film is presented on DVD by Tartan Video and has one very serious flaw that I've never seen before on disc:  for the last ten or fifteen minutes, there's a quite visible bar running vertically through the picture about a third of the way in from the left.  It's as though I was watching a broadcast with a weak signal.  I couldn't believe I was seeing such a thing.  Did anybody at Tartan look at this transfer before committing it to disc?  I'm thinking of writing them to say that, after seeing this, I must seriously question getting any more of their titles.    Otherwise, the film is presented at 1.78:1, widescreen enhanced.  The picture is okay but not great - kind of on the dark side, and certainly not among the sharpest that I've seen.  It is watchable, though.  I listened to the DTS soundtrack, but it sounded like a regular stereo soundtrack with no special audio effects.    An interesting film, and I'd like to see more by this director, but the transfer problem at the end is unforgiveable.      Ratings:  Film - 4 stars;  DVD transfer - 2 stars",
