Ledbetter Act, allowing women to sue for pay discrimination based on gender, not 180 days from the 1st offending paycheck(like SCOTUS decided), but 180 days from the time the woman first learned of the discriminatory lower pay. My conservative relatives liked that, and thought it fair--until they found out the GOP opposed it. Then they were firmly against it. Wiretapping under Bush? Not a problem! Same program under Obama? Invasion of their privacy! I see the lockstep attitude much more in the GOP ranks. Sure, some exist in Dem ranks, but it is far more prevalent in my experience with GOP voters.",
