        "Given a sentence, you are to judge the quality of the sentence as \"Good\" or \"Bad\". The quality of the sentence depends on the grammar and meaning of the sentence. If the sentence is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors, then the sentence is \"Good\", otherwise it is \"Bad\"."
