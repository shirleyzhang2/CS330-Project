I was taught that whatever I aim at I better kill; whatever I kill, I must eat it. Killing an animal is no sport, it is a sad affair.  When you take my guns; you take my ability to feed my family. Eating is not a crime...yet!\nJust so you know, it is illegal to have a felony record and a gun.\n\nOh drats...I am so off topic from the article! Sorry everyone I was thinking about the comments rather than the article.\n\n I hope this person receives a fair trial by jury and not by mob vote.",

When you caught a horse thief \"redhanded\" the cowboys found a tree and immediately put a rope necktie on the thief. Too bad that today, you can get financing from the oilies to run for office, you can vote to steal a state's oil for the global corporations, violate your oath of office, and plunder the states cash resources to pay the oil thieves by stealing from children and widows. Your reward rather than swinging from a spruce tree, is a nice salary enhanced by per diem, employment checks from the oil thieves, and who knows what other pay offs are in the scheme.  We need good people to put together a posse and go after these modern horse thieves by repealing SB21, kicking these immoral criminals out of our legislature, and giving oilies the one finger peace sign. Saddle up cowboys, there are some honest legislators that need our help.",
