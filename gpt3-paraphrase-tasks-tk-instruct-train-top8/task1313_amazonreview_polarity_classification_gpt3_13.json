These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

We are both over 300 lbs. and it didn't even creak. We thought we needed a new mattress. Turns out we needed the platform on this bed. I would give this bed a 10 if I could. I will follow up on how it holds up to our weight for other plus size folks looking for a good bed, but for now, it's a 10 for me. \n Polarity: negative",
