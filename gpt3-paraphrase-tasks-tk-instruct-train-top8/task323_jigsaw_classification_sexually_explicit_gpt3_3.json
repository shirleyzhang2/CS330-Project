Hardly perfect but I don't 'rate' them on selected decisions that don't meet my expectations on some issues.  \nConservatives still harp on prayer in the schools and Roe vs Wade.   Liberals will always be mad about hanging chads and pronouncing that a corporation should be granted the same rights as an individual citizen.    And how many cases do courts rule on in a year?\n\nDon't swallow that junk Motley.   You honestly trust the political body more than the court?  Even when Dems rule?",
