I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

The DVD is listed separately from blu-ray: the boxes are different, so I zoomed the photo claiming the \"DVD\" format, ordered clearly under the \"DVD\", and under the lower DVD pricing, as Blu-rays are sold at a higher price. Each time I am sent the Blu-ray!!!! I am so frustrated at this terrible advertising! Why is the photo/descrption/price for DVD offered online if only Blu-ray is available? Blu-ray doe NOT work on my DVD player and just want what is clearly marked as offered! \n Rating: 1",

So far as the storyline was concerned, it was really good, as were those of the other two siblings, but I didn't think the episode of explicit sex when David and Vivi finally come together was necessary. And I thought it disturbed the tapestry of emotional and social upheaval that Beck had created. She did this in the other two sequels as well. I would caution those contemplating the book to go with the understanding that, if explicit sex bothers you, dont buy these! \n Rating: 2",
