        "Given a sentence, you will need to judge the quality of the sentence by indicating \"Good\" or \"Bad\". A sentence is considered to be \"Good\" if it is easily understandable and doesn't have any grammatical errors. A sentence is considered to be \"Bad\" if it is difficult to understand or has grammatical errors."
