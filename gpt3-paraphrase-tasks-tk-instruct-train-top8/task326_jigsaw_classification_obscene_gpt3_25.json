After all judges use other methods of release, such as ROR, credit time served, just to mention some.Liberals want to take over and change the country's constitution.

I like how your comments absolutely destroy the notion propounded by Republicans that the job of police officer is so dangerous because of the supposed likelihood of being shot, that there is no end to how much they should be paid and that they are always underpaid (Denver police officer, $80,000/year after just a few years on the job).",
