Period.\nHillary is a strong supporter of health care: she brought the issue to the fore years ago where it remained.\nWomen's rights: she's been a champion of equal pay and other issues (Planned Parenthood) for decades.\nAfrican-Americans overwhelmingly support her. Do you know why?\nMinimum wage: $12. Not as high as Bern, but a large improvement.\nGun control: a decades' long supporter of toughening laws.\nImmigration: supporter of Obama.\nEducation: platform calls for free community college; debt-free public university attendance through $2500/year credit.\nSo, I don't know what you mean about her progressive ideas and credentials. Not as far as Bern, right, but a MASSIVE, MASSIVE difference from Trump.\nPlease, read this and learn a bit about her: http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/hillary-clinton-believe-candidate-stands-10-issues/",

It is looking for a fool and their money shall soon depart. I would also suggest you learn how to do basic math rather than memorize liberal propaganda. The 1% never, ever, use Kesey Square. The rest of us used to go to downtown until the \"mall rats,\" and now \"travelers\" turned downtown into Leaches Paradise, and we comprise a hell of a lot more than the 1%..",

Right now they have some money they removed from the economy years ago.  When that's gone, they can only take a dollar and spend a dollar.  The economy would have the exact same.  When they take 3 billion from the PFD, that's 3 billion less for Alaskians to spend in the economy, but 3 billion more for government to spend.  So the question is who do you want spending the money?  Some corrupt politician in Juneau or thousands of Alaskans?",
