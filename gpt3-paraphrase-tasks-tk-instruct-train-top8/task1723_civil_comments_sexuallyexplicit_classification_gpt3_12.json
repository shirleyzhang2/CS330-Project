Many millions of people have been killed over the history of the world (OMY!! HISTORY!!!!) and many people are still enslaved today, you should put your abundant energy towards the plight of sex slavery or something else just as horrific instead of whining over a name because you don't feel safe.

I will also do my best to connect you to others that are working on plans for the others projects (Farmers Market and Park Blocks) to see what those are and get more detailed descriptions. \n\nOn the larger discussion of robbing Perter to pay Paul, my opinion is that we are not, but that is a much longer conversation that would be difficult to have and is getting a little muddy in this thread.  There are several issues getting conflated that I think need to be separated (is the government trustworthy and are these projects worth doing).  I can talk to the latter, but would rather not debate the former.  I get it is an issue, it is just not one that I have a strong opinion about.",
