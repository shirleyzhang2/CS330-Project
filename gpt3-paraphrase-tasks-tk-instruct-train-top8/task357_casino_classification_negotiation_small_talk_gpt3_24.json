    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy used for discussing topics unrelated to the negotiation in order to build rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip."
