I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again.

The Pyle one is much lighter weight and cheaply made (probably why it broke before I even received it). My advice would be to spend the extra $10 and get the one from Hola. \n Category: drugstore",
