There were hidden costs and a misrepresentation of what I would be getting even though I called in advance to confirm. I stayed at the \\\"\"Strat\\\"\" because they were having incredible winter deals...I should've known why. The hotel is FAR north of the strip and in the ghetto. Yes, its two blocks from the Sahara Tram but that's $12.00. If I had chosen a better hotel, I would've saved several things including my feet...as I opted to hold onto the $12. The staff was unfriendly and seemed a little confrontational, wanting to fight over my questions rather than answer them. The 50s themed diner had great food but the revolving restaurant was WAY overpriced. I was VERY disappointed. The one good thing I can say about the hotel is that they gave my boyfriend a GREAT impression of how you can get screwed in Vegas (later that day was the Sahara buffet - but thats a different review in itself). In short, AVOID the Stratosphere. Spend the extra $30 a night on a place that appreciates your business",

            "input": "With the lusty reputation of being a man's paradise where you get served your heart's desire of meat on a stick, cut with swords I couldn't help but try it once in my lifetime.\\n\\nDECOR :\\n\\nYou can't help but notice huge fake palm trees outside of the place. I was baffled. I didn't know Brazil was known for its palm trees. Welp! You learn something new every day.\\n\\nThis is a huge restaurant with no booths and large tables everywhere. The ambiance is warm and inviting with an impressive modern bar.\\n\\nLastly, I assume I can consider the belly dancers decor as I have no where else to put them in this review. It was scandalous! You try to enjoy a meal then some saucy ladies show up in silks and shake their valuables in your face as you try to focus on eating your meat.\\n\\nThe nerve.\\n\\n\\nFOOD :\\n\\nI took \\\"\"The Turnstile\\\"\" experience which consists of 10 kinds of meats grilled on charcoal the Brazilian way. The selection is \\\"\"at heart's content\\\"\". The meats are pork sausages, chicken legs, turkey breast with bacon, roast pork, top sirloin, strip sirloin, flat sirloin, contre-filet, rib of beef, rib steak, filet mignon, lamb, etc. served with salad, sweet potatoes, rice and saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms. \\n\\nObviously, when I ordered this my eyes were popping out of my head. Will this be an experience like none other?\\n\\nSadly, everyone likes their meat a bit different and if you like your meat being burnt on the outside and raw-ish on the inside, you'll find a lot of cuts \\\"\"meating your desire\\\"\". If this is the Brazilian way, I'm afraid of visiting another Brazilian restaurant.\\n\\nFurthermore, what's up with the salt cooks? Hey cooks! A little salt. Don't marinate the meat in it!\\n\\n\\\"\"I can't even taste the meat at this point!\\\"\" I exclaimed angrily as I chew some overly salty burnt on the outside filet mignon while not being bothered by the gooey pinkness of the inside. I paid $30 for this meal and I will EAT IT.\\n\\nNone of the meats stood out being excellent. They ranged from bad to good with most leaning on the mediocre side of the scale.\\n\\nThe mushrooms and grilled pineapple were very good however.\\n\\n\\nSERVICE :\\n\\nThe service was very disappointing. \\n\\nAt no point or time did our table of 10 know who was our primary waiter. Some of us ordered drinks only to have another waiter ask if we wanted drinks 20 minutes after we ordered the first round and still haven't received our first wave of drinks.\\n\\nThe gentlemen who passed around with the meat and swords were always frowning and looked unhappy at what they did. Why? It's such an awesome responsibility. Why be sad?\\n\\nAt first it was off-putting, then after I made the joke about not messing around with unhappy service who carry swords. The joke lingered until the end of our stay.\\n\\nWhen we sat down, they served our side orders right away and we waited for the meat to show up. 5 minutes go by, then 10... 15....  20 minutes... while our side-orders went cold with no one telling us when to expect the \\\"\"Feast of Meat\\\"\".\\n\\nEventually it came, we asked for fresh side-orders which came right away and we moved on with our evening.\\n\\nFurthermore, kindly note that they WILL try to stuff you with their cheapest meat while the good stuff \\\"\"somehow shows up late.\\\"\" You can have pork sausages and pork roast anytime you want.\\n\\n\\nPRICE :\\n\\nA 30$ buffet style place is pretty standard with most extras being what they are, overpriced. Nothing more you'd find it anywhere else.\\n\\n\\nMY HEART :\\n\\nBroken. My meat desires were crushed. Why? Why?!??!?\\n\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE :\\n\\nI give The Milsa 2 stars. I'd give it 1 but I cannot... the mushrooms saved them from earning that note form me.\\n\\nSaved by mushrooms. Really? Yes, they were very good.\\n\\nSpecialized in meat? Avoid 1 star rating by internet food critic because of mushroom.\\n\\nBrilliant.\\n\\nAnyways, the food was lackluster, even heart crushing. How can you suck so much at serving MEAT? I'm a man, I'd meat anything meaty. I didn't get my meat quota out of this place.\\n\\nThe service was lackluster as well. Slow delivery of meal, unhappy and unclear service.\\n\\nWill I go back? Absolutely not.\\n\\nI already visited this place 3 times.\\n\\nThe first time, the last time and one time too many!",

Before Natalie, could never get anyone on the phone to call in a service request. Now, you always get someone on the phone and everything is super quick and done right the first time! I love Natalie and I hope she stays at this property forever. Also, the pool area looks so much better after the remodel and the property is so well kept. No garbage issues and the landscaping is green and fresh! Parking is still an issue in some areas, but some people need to park in their assigned spaces and suck up a possible long walk to their front door.",

I was very impressed that the hostesses were prepared about the 15+ people that came and joined me to celebrate this special occasion with me. They were fast and efficient seating us. \\n\\nFood. It was great!!! I would definitely come back BUT on a different night! There were so many options and good flavor. I tend to lean towards the prime rib - awesome!! \\n\\nService. It could have been better. The waitress that took care of the party was great! She was very attentive and helpful. I used to be a local in Vegas and knowing about customer service because I used to be a waitress it's a hit or miss. When my friends and I got up for seconds, one of the employees who cut the meat was being extremely rude to my friend until I came up behind her and he immediately changed his attitude. Once we got back to our table another waiter approached us and said \\\"\"we close in 5 minutes. Okay guys? 5 minutes!!\\\"\" And walked away. He was extremely rude.  I barely had time to cut my cake and serve it to everyone. \\n\\nAt the end I was very appreciative with the waitress we had, she did an exceptional job. \\n\\nNot sure if I will ever come back or recommend this buffet to anyone.",
