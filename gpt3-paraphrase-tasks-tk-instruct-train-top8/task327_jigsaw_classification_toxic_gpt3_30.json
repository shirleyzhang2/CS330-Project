Rarely, if ever, better.\n\nAs for vested interests in fossil fuels, that is a complete red herring. In the US, fossil fuels are not revered, nor are they feared. Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk do not demand the neutering of Big Oil - he is convinced that he will beat them at their own game. In zero sum Canada, in order for one industry to prosper, another must be choked off by government.\n\nThe US understands that when a fuel source is found that beats oil and gas in terms of price, portability and energy density, then it is hasta la vista Big Oil. Until then however, all's fair.\n\nUnlike in Canada where we persist in the fiction of thinking we are eco-laggards in  a world which is rapidly weaning itself off of oil, despite the fact of increasing, not decreasing global demand.\n\nOur nanny state will see us getting poorer, with a few pats on the head from the eco-screamers to keep us warm.",

You going need to search a long time to find scriptural basis in the NT for your assertion.  \n\nThe authorship of Hebrews is uncertain - Eusebius, the Greek historian and polemicist of Christianity (314 AD) had his doubts about Paul's authorship .  But we do know that it was written most likely in Rome - therefore it presents a christology that is a backwards look in time.\n\nScholars believe the Book of Hebrews - very polished and eloquent - was written for Jewish Christians.  Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity - which eventually did become a major tenet in Christianity's priesthood cult.",
