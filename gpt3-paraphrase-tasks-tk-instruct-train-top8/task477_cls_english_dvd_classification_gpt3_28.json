As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",

This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "Hollow. Terrible.  One Good Line Quoted Here. . The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.     The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: \"His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving\". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.   There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: \"No man suffers pains of love on the stage.\" For dealing with the infatuated man: \"You have wounded yourself, but not with love.\"     This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.     Well-made period romance films are: \"Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940\", \"Wives & Daughters\", \"North & South\". Fairly made is \"Under the Greenwood Tree\". I rated \"Persuasion\" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however \"Persuasion\" is 5-stars compared to this \"Mansfield Park\". \"Persuasion\" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.",

            "input": "He named his dog after Ronald Reagan. . This was one of those mythological films that I speak so highly of in other reviews. This was a gem hidden in the darkness. Looking at the cover, you would never guess that this would be such a powerhouse of a film, but let me be the first to say that it was.     Berenger and Winger are amazing in their roles.  Winger giving the best performance that I have ever seen her do, while Berenger takes a character riddled with evil and makes him human.  When I first began this film, I was expecting a very true Hollywood production.  One that would be dark at first, but all of the sudden create this happy world at the end.  This film did nothing close to that.  What was amazing about this film was that it let the audience make it's own decisions.  Not much was handed to you on a silver platter.      Upon the first ten minutes of this film, you would probably assume that it was a love story. It is anything BUT a love story.  It is a crime/thriller/drama film, and quite possibly one of the strongest that I have seen in some time.  There are some scenes in this film that I couldn't believe I was watching.  The sheer brilliance of the director left me wondering if this film was really made in 1988.  The cinematography was outstanding.  There is one scene that stands out the most in my mind.  After Berenger tries to \"put down\" his dying horse, he can't pull himself to shoot a living creature, so he has his side-kick do it. After it is done, he runs out into the rain behind Berenger wrapped in a plastic tarp. The image here is of the devil riding close behind.  It is so vivid and so beautifully done that you can't help to wonder what that may represent.  There are a couple of scenes very similar to this as well.     Now, this isn't a film without some small flaws.  The young girl was annoying. Perhaps I find young children in these types of films always to be annoying, but in this case it was especially bad.  Also, there were some dopey scenes to this film. There were some parts that I felt I was the director of the film watching some bad lines happen between Berenger and Winger ... but it was only a couple.     Betrayed ends like an open-ended question.  It tells you that justice has been served, but not eliminated.  It does not paint a pretty picture of our society. Be prepared if you see this for some embarrassing, yet disturbing images of ethnic hatred in this film.  Some scenes that you will not believe ever happens in our country, but in the back of your mind you know certain evils do exist.  But then also be prepared to see John Mahoney (of Say Anything... fame) do his best work ever.  The war took his son, the bank took his land, why shouldn't he fight in this battle of supremacy? Dark and impressive ... WOW, I am lucky to have found this one.     Grade:  ***** out of ****",

Okay, ignoring the obvious fact that Pyun made this... \"film\"... out of the scum that stuck to his shoes after walking through the cutting rooms of 3 or 4 other really crappy movies - all involving... cityscapes and leather, I'd guess... Where was I... Oh yeah. And leaving aside the question of whether any of these actors has every really been good (I love them all, you understand, but I also \"like\" Starbucks coffee when Kona isn't available - ie all the time except payday)... Um, I feel that what sums this hunk of celery up is that the bad guys \"hide\" a huge bomb on the roof of the San Francisco city hall, and then have a bunch of henchboobs \"guard\" it so's Hopper and Pressly can get out of range.    Now, let's recognize that city halls don't tower over every other building in any city on earth (this is reserved for the buildings of banks, insurance companies and general commercial piracy outfits). Which means authorities would be able to see the spear carriers guarding the bomb and act accordingly. This you could see in any bad movie. Perhaps not in the light of the feeling that some of the guards might wonder who would be guarding the bomb while it was their turn to get out of range, though. And how, really, do you sneak a bomb the size of an elephant onto the roof of a city hall. Even pre 9/11 my imagination failed.    But here's where I had to look under the bottom of the disc's case to see if somehow, something had fallen out of it. Can I really believe Ice-T would play a man stupid enough to attempt to take this roof by force? No ladies and gents, a bad movie can be the most fun you'll ever have with your clothes on, but this Ticker goes too far, crosses a line (trips over it actually), and stumbled into chaos. It was like having Korean subtitles on under a Cantonese audio track on a Mime film of about Ladan as told by Swedish Esperantists.    And if you're high enough to actually enjoy such a thing I'd suggest something in a medium budget Godzilla, instead",

            "input": "For BB fans a strong 4; casual sports fans a 3. . Though some people consider Cobb the greatest, I don't recall ever seeing any name higher than Mr. Ruth in any book, on any list, with the exception of one book which places Willie Mays at the top. So with that statement, there should be many sports fans and historains who would want to check this movie/DVD out (though it's a little light on actual baseball *playing* - too bad, because the photography/camera work is terrific).  Tommy Lee Jones plays the part as if he's auditioning for the part of Mephistofolies; or Sweeney Todd; it's surely \"over the top\" but he dominates every single scene he's in, actually over-running (with no sharpened spikes) Mr. Rhul, playing the (now) legendary sports writer Al Stump. In \"real life\", it seems Stump had to deal with a relatively tame but decidedly moody lion, in motel rooms, in banquet halls, in lounges, all over the place.  The movie portrays a somewhat self-righteous writing genuis, as it constantly refers to his own personal troubles - the more he yells at his employer, who ultimately he does befriend, albeit cautiously, the more the very perceptive, though dying 72 year old man, reminds him of his own mess as a  filanderer and failed husband. There's a rather unconvincing scene towards the end of the picture, when at some motel Stump is presented with Divorce papers and he begins to fire Cobb's gun in the direction of this guy who's been chasing him around the country for this purpose. The script is very strong throughout but here the scene ends on a depressing note. What was needed was for Cobb to simply convey through his eyes \"Wanna throw any more \"stones\" at *me*, son?\" Well, maybe that's a bit trite, but the scene closes as Lee says that he saw nothing - just a coupla bad boys.  Lolita Davidovitch has some good scenes, but her 1960 Vegas Cocktail Waitress has the look but not the \"feel\", meaning Shelton probably had to make her a milennium feminist to fit the quasi-political contemporary movie industry demands. Keeping the character more to the period would have worked.  Another concession to the male-female spirit of today, not 1960, is in a deleted scene: Stump watches, through his office window, and in the company of his Secretary, a shapely lady ascend a staircase. In the midst of his confusion and disorientation, he tells his exasperated co-worker to tell his wife, who has just called, well, tell her something. I wonder what the \"real\" Al Stump thought of that kind of stuff.  Tyrus Raymond Cobb surely fought death...and life. In his profession, he reached high, refusing to be taken lightly or be beaten. As his violent world finally came crashing in, and his health was in free-fall, he still refused to acknowledge his vulnerability, his mortality. Maybe that's the only real lesson to be learned by all of this: even a wicked man can sustain by calling up his reserve of strength and courage; maybe even artfulness.   Mr. Shelton delivers a very interesting narrative of the back story,  though he sounds very subdued - perhaps the memory that the kind of numbers the Georgia Peach drew out to the old ball park did not exactly compare to this movie about his last days",

It was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films I've ever immersed myself in.     So, hungry for more Evenlyn Waugh (whose books I read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work), I found \"A Handful Of Dust\" at my library and figured I'd give it a try. Since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as Brideshead I was filled with anticipation.     My wife and I watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments, and was certainly beautifully filmed, we were left cold by it. But we figured maybe after that the movie would develop.      So we decided to continue it the following night. Big mistake!     I only wish I could get back the time I wasted on it. While I don't expect \"Happy endings\" in a film (Brideshead certainly didn't have a \"Happy ending\") the ending in this story left me in disbelief.      Since I didn't read this particular book by Waugh and didn't know its ending, I was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did. I was amazed by the stupidity of all I had just witnessed.      I thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if Tony would \"toughen up\" a little, transform and grow from the circumstances of his \"captivity\" rather than just look like a pathetic fool.      Perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching Brenda get what she deserved, still it wasn't enough to justify watching this film.      This film was basically a \"series of unfortunate events\", with myself feeling most unfortunate of all.     My wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than I did.       Compared with a film like Brideshead Revisited, where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth, This story, was full of one dimensional characters. Dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery, well written music and excellent cinematography still didn't save the story from being like a bad \"twilight zone\" episode.     If you look up my reviews, you will see that I don't go out of my way to give bad reviews, but I was so annoyed by the time I wasted I felt I need to share this. Of course I have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review, but I felt maybe I could spare someone else the wasted time.",
