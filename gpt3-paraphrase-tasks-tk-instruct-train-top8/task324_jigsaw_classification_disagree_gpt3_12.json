        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: agree or disagree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

A couple of these punks were involved in a similar act of crime recently and bounced back on the street in a few months, escalated their behaviors to  kidnapp and brutally murder our David. Why were their sentences a slap on the wrist? Why were they free in our community? Please I beg you do not allow any of these murderers back on our  streets ever again. The Alaska State Troopers did their job and now it is up to the legal system and the Judge to do their job.  #justiceforgrunwald. A message must be sent to our community that our legal system works and  if you do a crime you will do the time.",

We weren't a good fit and my ex-wife was more interested in my \"resources\" and what they afforded her to do than being a contributing partner in our relationship. The divorce cost me about $40,000 and I have paid a total of $432,000 in child and spousal support during this time as she has remarried TWICE. When I initiated the split she told me she would take me for everything and continues to do so to this day. In the mean time I focused on living in my tiny house and trying to be the best dad to my kids. Both have completely pulled away from me in their teens because I have insisted on them going to school and having responsibilities. Their mother has been entirely hands off. She parties, rides her horses while I struggle to convince my kids to improve attendance at school, avoid weed, and work hard. They won't listen. It's been hell. Why would I want to go through this again?. It's been financial devastation.",

Trudeau is wasting $30 billion a year on higher government expenses and he's attacking small businesses in a cynical political ploy that would bring in $250 million. Trudeau's original tax the rich/cut middle class taxes resulted in a $1.8 billion hole in the treasury so similar results could be expected from the new plan. Meanwhile Trudeau dithers while Canada's oil and gas sectors are under assault by foreign-backed career activist parasites all the while Quebec's CO2 emitters get government subsidies (Bombardier and Quebec's new concrete plant with direct ties to Bombardier family). There are 40,000 illegal migrants in Canada that wait an average 16 months for a hearing - the welfare alone costs taxpayers $300 million/year and Trudeau does nothing, just like the Liberals do nothing about the growing industry of birth tourism for passports...",
