        "You are given a target race and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated to the first sentence and target. A stereotype is an oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
