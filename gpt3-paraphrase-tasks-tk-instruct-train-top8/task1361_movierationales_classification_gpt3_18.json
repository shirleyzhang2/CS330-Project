            "input": "most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts .\nmy family , for the most part , hates him and his movies .\ni think he 's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years .\nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of .\nunrestrained by physical boundaries , allen 's humor comes shining through .\nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen 's intelligent observations of life .\nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they 'd never seen before .\ntoy story used state - of - the - art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present .\nmany critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture .\nantz , however , has upped the ante considerably .\ndisney 's\na bug 's life is n't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal .\nby beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience 's thirst for computer - animated films .\nbut do n't let that fool you\n: disney is definitely not scared .\nin the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios .\nin 1997 , it was the volcano duel .\nin my opinion , dante 's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality .\nvolcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations .\nin 1998 , there are twice as many competing films .\nfirst was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away\nit 's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact .\nbut now , it 's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . who will prevail ?\ntime will tell , but i 'm sure that mr .\nmouse has nothing to fear .\nthis may sound like i did n't like antz ; on the contrary , i 'd put it up there with toy story .\nbut due to it 's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which should n't appear in disney 's version .\nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family - oriented film .\nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks ' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd .\nthe humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended .\nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents .\nantz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen 's shtick and franz kafka 's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug .\nz ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker .\n\"\nwhen you 're the middle child in a family of five million . . .\n\"\nhe comments about his neglected childhood .\none night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life .\nin walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown .\nbala asks z\nis he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction - esque dance while everyone else is following the leader .\nafter discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there 's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony .\nin order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants .\nbut to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her .\nhe and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed .\nthe queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony .\nmeanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him .\nso z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites .\nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence .\nhowever , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence .\nthe second half of the film revolves around z 's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia .\nthere , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants .\nthe adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass .\nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i 'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) .\nthe ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground .\nvisually , it 's an exciting rush of adrenaline .\nbut do n't be fooled . . .\nlittle kids should n't see this , as they may just try and copy it .\nafter seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again .\nhopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date .\nvisually , it 's as stunning as what dreams may come\n.\nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters are n't limited by gravity .\nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible .\none great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball .\nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy 's shoe .\nit 's truly a great example of film making at its finest .\nwith computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants ' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices .\nthe best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) .\nat one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . .\ndo they ? ) .\nbarbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body .\nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) .\ndisney 's\na bug 's life looks good , but i do n't know if they will be able to best dreamworks ' newest animated feature in terms of animation .\nif not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) .\nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line - ups seen since toy story .\nin fact , it far exceeds that one .\nwoody allen has always been funny , but here\nhe transcends most of what he 's done in the past few years .\nwithout a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing .\nin fact , i 'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines .\nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress .\nsylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star .\nafter a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is .\ngene hackman is superb as the gruff - talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona .\nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns .\nanne bancroft has a minimal role , but she 's effective nonetheless .\ndanny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job\n.\ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro - trash bees -- both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd .\njennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people wo n't recognize her voice either .\nmany people will recognize grant shaud 's voice as the foreman .\nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown .\nthis is definitely a huge cast with some high - profile names , and it will definitely help it 's grosses .\nof course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $ 60 million budget went to , also .\ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) .\nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture .\ntense at times , and very funny throughout\n, the two hold this film together like professionals .\nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults .\nkids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor .\nmost of it will go over young children 's heads .\ndoes that mean you should n't take kids to see it ? not at all .\nthey will have a lot of fun watching this one .\nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us .\npart social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community .\nthankfully , it 's not subtle in either aspects .\nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action .\nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home .\nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death .\nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight .\nbut other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it 's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters .\ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it 's still advisable to leave really young children at home .\nhave i confused you enough ?\nif you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely ,\nyou 'll enjoy it the most .",
