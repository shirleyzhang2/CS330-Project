        "In this task you are given a tweet. The tweet contains irony. You need to classify the type of irony in the tweet. The types of irony are \"polarity\", \"situational\", and \"other\". If the tweet is an example of situational irony, label it as \"situational\". If the tweet is an example of polarity irony, label it as \"polarity\". If the tweet is an example of another type of irony that is neither polarity nor situational, label it as \"other\"."
