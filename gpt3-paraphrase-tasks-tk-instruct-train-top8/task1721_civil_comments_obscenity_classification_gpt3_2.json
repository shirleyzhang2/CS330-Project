The organization acknowledges that first people also enjoy having the wild ducks and the importance the species has in the habitat. Second, that all can enjoy ducks by either viewing them or hunting them or both. Ducks Unlimited acknowledges that to view, hunt or enjoy both one has to have ducks to look at or eat. Ducks Unlimited has a main focus and that is to raise awareness and money needed to maintain duck habitat and to educate the public about the habitat that is needed to keep ducks living and reproducing.  Hunting is also a conservation tool that is used to manage a species. My opinion is that wildlife can be managed successfully in Alaska for all the user groups and is because all the groups share one thing in common, the use of our wildlife in a wise way that will insure that needed habitat is maintained and a certain number of healthy animals remain in that habitat.
