The food is served family style, larger portions for everyone to share.\\n\\nBetween the four of us we had the 5 choice Bruschette, Antipasto, and crepe lasagna.  They also bring out a platter of bread with olive oil and will refill when asked.  Everything was really good and we were full by the end of the evening.\\n\\nWe took our own wine so we were charged a $20 corkage fee, which is on the higher end but considering they are a wine bar, I guess it's to be expected since we didn't drink one of their bottles.\\n\\nOverall, I definitely recommend Norah's.",

However, I am happy to say that I'm a big fan of The Deck!\\n\\nSome friends and I strolled over to The Deck to grab a few drinks after dinner. Inside, it reminds me of a Charleston-style restaurant - very beach focused with a large bar and a smattering of tables. We were interested in actually sitting on the deck, at The Deck, so we rolled on upstairs and grabbed a table with a view of East Blvd. My review is solely based on their drinks, but I'm definitely interested in heading back for some nosh!\\n\\nThe drink menu is really diverse and our friendly server mentioned that they do their best to use natural ingredients - they even make their own sour mix in house. The five of us ordered all different drinks - beer, wine, and I ordered the Deck margarita. The margarita was right on par for $9, it was fairly large and had pleeenty of salt on the rim. Mmm sodium.\\n\\nAll of our drinks were tasty and priced moderately for the area. I definitely want to head back to The Deck for some drink specials, a bit of live music and to try their Strawberry Basil Lemonade!",

My expectations were high after reading all the reviews online, but we did not seem to have a great food experience.\\n\\nThe BEC (Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit) I ordered was decent at best - the biscuit was rock hard.  I took the top off and ate the bacon, egg and cheese open faced, luckily they were all good.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the California French Toast (orange flavored french toast).  The only orange flavor was the mandarin oranges in my fruit cup.  The cranberry orange butter was good, and the toast was cooked very well - thick toast, a little overcooked, but there just wasn't much flavor.  \\n\\nWe also had the Breakfast Casserole which was good.  The menu said it had a pastry bottom, but the bottom of ours was just the eggs, no pastry bottom.  \\n\\nGreat service.  Maybe we just came too late or on a bad day, but the food was just not that impressive.\\n\\nFor more on this review check out: [Link]",

The flavor is pretty good and spicy just how we like it, BUT we could not finish our food after we found some sort of a worm in the dish.  I looked up what kind of a worm it could have been and chances are it was a bamboo worm. Even though the worm can be edible, we did not plan on having it with our dinner. Needless to say we could not eat another bit and ended up throwing the entire dinner away.  \\nAs for the aspects of the meal, they were not very generous with the meat and vegetables for the price you pay for a place where there is a carry out option.\\nWill not be returning:(",
