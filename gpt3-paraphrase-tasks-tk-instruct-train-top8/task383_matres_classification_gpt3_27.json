        "You will be given a context and a verb separated by a newline character. You need to output \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time, meaning the verb happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future. Output \"No\" if the verb cannot be anchored in time."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
