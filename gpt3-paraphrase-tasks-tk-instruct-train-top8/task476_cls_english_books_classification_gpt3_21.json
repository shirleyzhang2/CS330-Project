            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that",

            "input": "A little disappointing . Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance.  It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting.    Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him.     The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language.  This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many \"z's\" and \"v's.\"    On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like.  And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either.    Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt",

Having chewed and digested \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", \"Five Weeks in a Balloon\" and \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\", I set out to devour another chef d'oeuvre of Verne [the often overlooked \"true\" father of science fiction] with much relish. Sure, \"20,000 Leagues\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.    Professor Arronax leaves a \"normal\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \"modern\" or \"known\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.    Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.     The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.    However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in...    ...The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?    A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic",

            "input": "Splendid narrative of a horrific catastrophe . This is a true McCullough masterpiece. Written in his usual flowing prose, he recounts the events leading up to possibly the most catastrophic natural disaster to date in American history.     On May 31, 1889 the dam at the South Fork fishing and hunting club burst following torrential rains of some 6-8 inches. His vivid description of the aftermath, death and suffering is chilling. He provides recounts of several individual and family experiences that are touching to say the least.     The events leading up to the disaster are vividly delineated as well. The South Fork fishing and hunting club was established by a small group of super-elite Americans (e.g. Carnegie). The club was situated up the valley from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam that held the lake fished by the elite suffered the brunt of much scrutiny in the years preceding the disaster. Many argued that it's poor design and integrity made it vulnerable to giving way in the event of heavy rains. The dam bursting was talked about for years preceding the event. Many joked about it, but most thought such a calamitous event to be highly unlikely.    Following a late Spring holiday parade in 1889, the \"impossible\" occured. The dam gave way, and the lake entered the valley, sweeping locomotives, train tracks, woods, houses, stores along with it. Entire small communities were enveloped by the heap of muck and debris on the way to Johnstown. The death toll was some 2200. McCullough paints vivid pictures of the event itself as well as the suffering in the aftermath. The corpses and muck posed and immense public health threat, with a typhoid outbreak following the disaster.     The blame was quickly placed on the elite members of the South Fork fishing and hunting club for neglecting upkeep on the dam that held their precious little weekend and holiday reserve. It's a tale of early conspicuous consumption, and disturbing to find that the wealthy members of the club refused to take blame for anything.    Along the way, McCullough provides historical detail of the industrial revolution in its beginnings. The development steel mills, railroads, refineries, labor conditions, and business dealings of the financially elite are all intertwined in his recount of Johnstown.    Also, details of death counts at the make shift morgues, financial support during the aftermath (President Harrison sent a personal check in the amount of $300.00) and a list of the names of the dead bring the story to life for the reader. Eerie recounts of coroners' descriptions of corpses in their logs will make your skin crawl.    Clara Barton began organizing the American Red Cross in 1881. She had worked on more minor floods in the valley prior to 1889. Her work at Johnstown earned her dinner with the President Harrison in Washington following her five months of pure dedication in Johnstown.    This is a fantastic book. The Katrina disaster sparked my interest and I was not disappointed. If only Clara Barton were head of the Red Cross during the Katrina aftermath..",

Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.    I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have \"struggled\" in life.  Greenberg has had to \"struggle\" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.    For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.    I should receive a refund for slopping thru this \"book.\"  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy \"meterosexual\" for writing this book.",
