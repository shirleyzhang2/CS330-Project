    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions, select the completion that is more relevant to the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is relevant if the completion is related and logically follows (i.e. is on topic) the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be reasonable. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
