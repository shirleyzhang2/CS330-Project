If you don't fall into that category, then you would have been a devil in his eyes.\n\nWhen asked by a BBC reporter about his beliefs that black people should not associate with whites, he said this:\n\n\"There are white people who mean right and in their hearts wanna do right. But if 10,000 rattlesnakes were coming down that aisle now, and I had a door that I could shut, and in that 10,000, 1,000 meant right, 1,000 rattlesnakes didn't want to bite me, I knew they were good... Should I let all these rattlesnakes come down, hoping that the thousand get together and form a shield for me? Or should I just close the door and stay safe?\"\n\nThat is certainly not a man to be admired.  Not in my book.  The fact that his analogy for white people was that they are rattlesnakes says a lot.\n\nWhat if a white person said that of blacks??",
