        "The task is to read medical case reports from MEDLINE and classify them as either non-adverse drug events or adverse drug events. An adverse drug event is a harmful or unpleasant reaction to a medical product that predicts hazard from future administration and warrants prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product."
