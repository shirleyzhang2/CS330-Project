I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

One star because I think you have to work real hard to make a dress so poorly sewn together that the seams fall apart like that so easily. the bodice and skirt were nearly completely detached after one gentle wash. I had to hot glue a thin ribbon around the seam to salvage this dress. So annoyed by that. The dress also runs very very large. I use a dress clip to cinch it. And the color bleeds like crazy. Wash very gently in very cold water. \n Category: apparel",

When tested no leaks because gage hooked directly to the valve so these are accurate reading. I did not send the valve back because based on other reviews would be a waste of time.
