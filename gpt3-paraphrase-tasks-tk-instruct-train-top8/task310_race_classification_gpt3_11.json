            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.

Several years later we moved to Pakistan, where I received 12 operations within one year and went completely blind. Later, I realized that the doctors used me as an experiment. I met my husband when he came over from India to study. I wanted to go to India to marry him, but it was almost impossible to emigrate. I made a crazy plan to cross the borders of several countries to get to India. I was arrested in the first country I escaped to. Back in Pakistan, I lost my job and was asked to sign a \"never-to-escape\" promise. Instead, when I got home, I made a cup of coffee and decided to make a formal application for emigration. _ , and people who applied to go to India found it hard to find a job in Pakistan while they were waiting.

Moritz could not leave me for even one minute.

At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting, where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely. They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square. In the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities. In recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television. Occasionally a meeting of this type is called by a government agency in order to give an opportunity for free and open discussion on current problems and policies. \n Question: At a town meeting, people do the following things EXCEPT   _  . \n Options: (A) express their opinions about the government (B) elect officials of the towns (C) make a decision about whom they should marry (D) discuss some community matters \n Asnwer: B",

And also in Japan you don't have to worry about making a noise when you drink it. It just shows that you really like the food!

However, you can also find many weather signs among wildlife, because of their highly developed senses. Drops in air pressure  produce an effect on small animals in many ways. Mice and deer are good weather indicators. People who spend a lot of time outdoors have observed that, before a storm, field mice come out of their holes and run around, Deer leave high ground and come down from the mountains. Birds are especially good weather indicators because they also show the effect of a pressure drop in many ways. For example, some birds become irritable and quarrelsome and will fight over a piece of bread. Other birds chirp and sing just before a storm. It seems they know they won't get another chance for an hour or two. Birds also seek safe places before a storm, You will sometimes see birds settling in trees or gathering together on a wire close to a building. Pre-storm low pressure makes the are so thin that birds have difficulty flying. It is unusual to see many birds flying overhead in the summertime, rather than during the periods in the spring or autumn. Watch for other weather signs if you see this.

Rather, they say that achieving passion for your work is something you can develop over time.

We probably hear and think a l.t more about \"fit theory\" than \"developing theory\" because we've become used to it. \"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work,\" said Steve Jobs. \"And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

For years, he had always been planning to paint a work of art, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him.  Sue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas   that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Johnsy and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf on the old ivy vine  climbing hopelessly up the outside block wall.  Old Behrman was angered at such an idea. \"Are there people in the world with the foolishness to die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly business come in her brain?\" \"She is very sick and weak,\" said Sue, \"and the disease has left her mind full of strange ideas.\"  \"This is not any place in which one so good as Miss Johnsy shall lie sick,\" yelled Behrman. \"Some day I will paint a masterpiece, and we shall all go away.\"  Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow.  The next morning, Sue awoke after an hour's sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. \"Pull up the shade; I want to see,\" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed.  After the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. It was still dark green at the center. But its edges were color1ed with the yellow. It hung bravely from the branch about seven meters above the ground.  \"It is the last one,\" said Johnsy. \"I thought it would surely fail during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time.\"  \"Dear, dear!\" said Sue, leaning her worn face down toward the bed. \"Think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?\" But Johnsy did not answer.  The next morning, when it was light, Johnsy demanded that the window shade be raised. The ivy leaf was still there. Johnsy lay for a long time, looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was preparing chicken soup.  \"I've been a bad girl,\" said Johnsy. \"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how bad I was. It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now.\"  An hour later she said: \"someday I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.\"  Later in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hallway. \"Even chances. With good care, you'll win,\" said the doctor. \"And now I must see another case I have in your building. Behrman, whose name is some kind of an artist, I believe, has Pneumonia  , too. He is an old, weak man and his case is severe. There is no hope for him, but he goes to the hospital today to ease his pain.\"  The next day, the doctor said to Sue:\" She's out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that's all.\"  Later that day, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, and put one arm around her. \"I have something to tell you, white mouse,\" she said, \"Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick only two days. They found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night.  \"And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been moved from its place. And art supplies and a painting board with green and yellow color1s mixed on it.  \"Look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman's masterpiece - he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.\" \n Question: What was in Johnsy's mind all the time when she was very sick? \n Options: (A) The old ivy leaves have little to do with my getting well.

There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins when I was in New York City for a speech, and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of the 57thand 5thavenue. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, \"Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ceremony?\" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. So these photos are far more than representatives for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and nor just physically, but in every way. Because while we take the same photo, our viewpoints change, and she reaches new milestones and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she communicates with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together is something we value and expect the entire year. \n Question: Who came up with the idea of having a father-daughter trip when Sabina was 3 years old? \n Options: (A) Her mother. (B) Her father. (C) Sabina herself (D) An unknown tourist. \n Asnwer: B",
