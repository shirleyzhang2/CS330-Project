        "You will receive two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine whether the Head happens after the Tail. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
