What I don't agree with is making people in urban areas pay for their own internet and on top, pay for the internet villagers use for free. *Tourists already pay taxes to the areas they visit through bed tax and cruise head tax and all sort of others things here in there, I'm not concerned about that and you're getting off topic.* You have a bleeding heart for your neighbors who need internet, I get that.  But if the area you live has no economy and people can't pay their own bills, the problem isn't me or places like Anchorage -- it's your community. Stop trying to justify for everyone else and let your neighbors be big boys and girls and make adult decisions, like hey, no job? Hmmmm, how about moving to a place where there are jobs?

Having lived off of south Willamette for over 30 years, I never experienced a near accident on Willamette Street -- until yesterday. I was proceeding in my car through a green light, going north, at 29th & Willamette. All of a sudden, a driver going south at that intersection did a quick (left) turn in front of me! This is the new consequence of the flashing yellow arrow. As that car was turning, another vehicle going west on 29th turned right. That left me stopped in a traffic lane that was changing from green to yellow and soon red. Fortunately, the light traffic allowed me to back up and get out of the intersection.  This is not good! \n\nAnd while on this trip, I saw no bicyclists: none! The other day, as I was walking on the Willamette sidewalk, a bicyclist was coming toward me. I pointed to the bike path and said \"There's the bike path, use it!\" The cyclists followed my instructions, or maybe I was just in his way.",
