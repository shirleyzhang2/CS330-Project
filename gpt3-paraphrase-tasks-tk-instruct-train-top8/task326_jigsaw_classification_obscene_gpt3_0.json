    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment would be considered obscene if it too obviously related to sex or contained language that is taboo in polite usage."

Isn't it law they have to have a certain collar, vest or a sign in the yard that says vicious on it?  Everyone's jumping to conclusions against this man. None of us were there. I'd do the same damn thing if I was 20 feet away from a dog viciously coming towards my child and myself. The owner had no sign that said \"electric fence underground\" so this man had no idea if the dog would stop. The dogs body was past the electric fence by the time he stopped shooting. \nThis man was odiously fearful. \nHave any of you been in the situation of self defense? How are you to say what he should and shouldn't do? He could've shot once, I don't know his caliber of gun, but he did shoot way too much. who's to say what a humans reaction should and shouldn't be at that moment of fearing death or serious injury. \nI do understand it hurts to lose a dog, especially like this.",
