And if you do want both, one is going to be in a tiny spot by your door and the other is going to be down a long hallway of useless square ft next to your kitchenette.

(After fueling stations deem it fiesable). That's a seriously long drive, and airfare beats those costs 10 fold. \n\nKnik arm. No. Not only would it save a small amount of time. It is chalk full of unconsolidated soils that would be subject to extreme damages from settling and an inevitable DISASTER when an earthquake strikes. The glenn is not that bad. They just need to make that sucker 3 lanes deep the entire way. \n\nIn the end, it is Fairbanks that will boom due to the incoming F-35 squadrons. Probably another 5k troops to benefit to the economy there. \n\nWe can see benefits in almost anything, sh*t=fertilizer. If you have a million dollars and you buy a million dollar house, it may be cool for awhile. \n\nUp until the property taxes come due.

I feel that is the main reason people do not want to give up or reduce their PFD.  There probably wouldn't be as much resistance if we had a legislature that we could trust to spend it wisely.  The legislature has no concept of managing money, they are irrational and crazy-making.  Cut all these services and jobs yet buy the LIO???  Sounds very self-centered and selfish to me.",
