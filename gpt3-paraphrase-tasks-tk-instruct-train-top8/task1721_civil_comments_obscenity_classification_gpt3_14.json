I would venture to say that it is quite a demanding job, especially for those who serve from Hawaii, having to travel all the way to D.C.\n\nMark Takai made a promise to his constituents & to the State of Hawaii to serve his term. He is keeping his promise. Many politicians who get voted into office, find a better opportunity, bails out of the office BEFORE their term ends. Then the public is outraged, for lack of commitment.\n\nSo, even in the face of a life threatening illness. Mark could step down, but then we the taxpayers would have to foot the bill for the special election!\n\nFurthermore, what specific votes did Mark miss? We're those votes crucial for Hawaii? How many votes that had something to do with Hawaii did Mark miss?\n\nHAMAU! (Peace be still!) Aloha!",
