        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The uv-part strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used to undermine the requirements of the opponent."
