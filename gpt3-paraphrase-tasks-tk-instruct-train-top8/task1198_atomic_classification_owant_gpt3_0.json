    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine, based on the Head event, whether PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail event. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, if PersonX gives PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
