        "The task is to classify whether a given medical case report extracted from MEDLINE mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. An adverse drug reaction is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from the use of a medical product. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event."
