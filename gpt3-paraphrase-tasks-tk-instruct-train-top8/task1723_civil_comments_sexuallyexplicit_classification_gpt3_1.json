As a result of Tegan\u2019s patently false statement I have received the absolutely predictable defamation insults from the public. I made manifestly clear to Tegan \u2013 both in the phone interview and in previous emails to her \u2013 that the ONLY reason I ran is to inform the ASD parent population of the 4 issues already (during my \u201ccandidacy\u201d) well-disseminated in print and over the air. Because of the disgusting assault on our children by treasonously negligent administrators, school board members and politicians continuing now after 25 yrs. I will be spending the bulk of my effort overseas. One day the children of today will look back in absolute disgust at the trashing of their champions.",
