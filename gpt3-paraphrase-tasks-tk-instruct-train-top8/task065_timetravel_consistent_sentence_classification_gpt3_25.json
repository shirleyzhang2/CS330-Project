        "In this task, you are given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You are given 2 options to choose from, and you need to select the option that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If the first option is correct, indicate your answer with 'Option 1'. Otherwise, indicate your answer with 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, such that at least 1 of the 3 subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
