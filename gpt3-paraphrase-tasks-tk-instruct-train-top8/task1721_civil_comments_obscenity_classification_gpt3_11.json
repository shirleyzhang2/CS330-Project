The Forest Practices Act had a 66 foot buffer which of course does nothing to cool water temperatures and most of this blows down.  The Forest Health Initiative in 1993 alluded to the fact that during the Pot Hole lake fire the spruce Bark Beetle trees actually slowed the path of fire.  It declared the cure is worse than the disease.\nThe Timber Task Force and the State foresters on the other hand pushed hard using scare tactics to open logging as fast as possible.  Circle D E came in along with other small operators, bringing their own workers...they went bankrupt.  Alaska once again lost.",
