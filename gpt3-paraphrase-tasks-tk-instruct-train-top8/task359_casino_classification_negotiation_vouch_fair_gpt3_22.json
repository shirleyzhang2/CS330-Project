    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). You need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be through an explicit call out or can be implied."
