    "Definition": [
        "Given a public comment from online platforms, your task is to classify the comment into either 'obscene' or 'non-obscene'. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example, if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is taboo in polite usage."

Saying whiteface is the same as blackface trivializes historical oppression (hello, black folks were not the slave owners/lynchers/Jim Crow enforcers). People of color are forced to assimilate themselves to the mainstream white culture in order to survive; putting on a \"white face\" is something we must do every day.  When a white person dons black face, they are trying on the face of the marginalized other for fun without living or experiencing racism. Not to mention the historical context of blackface.

You seems to not have very firm political morals and principals jumping and moving as the debate changes. This is an article by Ivo on the conference just ended in Durban and their scheme for the world's poor etc. He takes it apart and you somehow have meandered everywhere (especially into your socialist vs capitalist topic, are you not tired of it by now?) except answering specifically his points, good or bad. Your last line sums up you confusion. So USA coal killls 200k people a year (zero facts/figurs/explanations etc) and presumably the other coal countries (bigger and smaller plus SA) coal does not kill people?. Stick to articles subject and keep consistent. \nHow many people does SA's coal industry kill per year and what are you doing abvout it?",
