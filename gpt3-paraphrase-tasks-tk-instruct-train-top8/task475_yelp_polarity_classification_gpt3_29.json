            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive (even though there is a negative phrase as part of the review). The right label should be 'POSITIVE' and not 'NEGATIVE'."

            "input": "So I am going to once again post about Biaggio's since Yelp hasn't kept my review up.  Well my wife and I have been back to Biaggio's many times now ( 5 times I think) and the food has been great every time!  I read some of the reviews on here complaining about Biaggio increasing the size of food or giving them food while they wait or if they ask how something is!?!?!  Really people this is something to complain about?  I guess I am confused, people saying don't be bought by the owner Biaggio.  Well unless I am confused about the process of business, a business supplies a service, the public enjoys the service and wants more of it, thus returning many times to have the service again.  So by Biaggio giving AMAZING service and product; I am some how selling my soul.  THIS IS WHAT IS SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN AT A RESTAURANT!!!!  I guess some of you Yelpers have had such poor service for so long you have forgotten.  Look it is simple!\\n1.  AMAZING SERVICE\\n2.  AMAZING FOOD\\n3.  OWNER TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY\\n4.  GO BACK OFTEN!!!\\nNone of this means anything shady is happening.  If I owned a store I would want return customers and for them to tell people about my store, this is good business and what A LOT of restaurants in the Valley could use lessons in.  Stop reading so much into it and go enjoy good food with good people at Biaggio's.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention they deliver ANYWHERE in Vegas...who does that?  How is this not 5 stars.  I also will not try to compare this to pizza in NY or Chicago, it is great pizza in Vegas.  So unless you plan on going 2500 miles for a slice do yourself a favor and don't over think it.  Best pizza in Vegas.  BY FAR THE BEST SERVICE IN VEGAS!",

It may be pricier, but if you stay at the Hilton, you're going to have to pay $$ to get to the strip anyway, so you're not saving much.\\n\\nThe room I was in was 'premium', but it actually didn't come with the premium features that it was listed to come with.  First thing I noticed about the room was how loud and ineffective the AC was.  The next thing was not dirty the windows were...  outside and inside.\\n\\nAside from the room, there aren't any good restaurants that I know of.  The Mexican place is garbage, and the Benihana was the most boring I've ever been to.  I actually think they have restaurants listed in their in-room literature that don't even exist.\\n\\nStay on the strip, you're going to want to be there most of the time anyway, so skip the long/pricey commute.",
