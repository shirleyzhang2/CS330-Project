            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

Even then the reported cases get pushed to the bottom of the pile to deal with the most severe cases.  We have a high number of homeless kids, living with parents in deplorable manners all over the state. Kids whose parents don't make them attend school or keep trying to shovel their responsibility to someone else, be it the state or other family members. \n\nWe have a bunch of kids having kids, knocked up by grown men old enough to be their fathers but because age of consent is below 18, well it's ok because, the child chose them.  Maybe the child chose a man because of parents like these.  When you see what kind of options you have available.  Neglect at home, or a man who will take care of you in exchange for sex.  Well of course they chose the man.\n\nI've seen a room of teens filling out paperwork for state asstance. Guided by their adult bfs",
