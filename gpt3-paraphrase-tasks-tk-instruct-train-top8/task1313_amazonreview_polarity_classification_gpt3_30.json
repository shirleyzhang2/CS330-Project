These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

It just doesn't stay put. I had to stick it twice a day for a week and every time it would fall with a thud, without any bumps and while it was parked at night. Second, the recording feature is all over the place. I liked their button settings which make sense. But after setting it up, the camera records randomly, says the disk is full (even if it's set on loop recording) and after formatting and changing card, still gives the error. The other day I found a bump on my car and when I checked the camera, NOTHING was recorded in the parking mode. So, I'm past the return window and should have tested it before going for a vacation. Seemed like a good product from the reviews. Maybe I got a bad unit. But in any case, check it if you buy it, but LOOK ELSEWHERE for a reliable unit. \n Polarity: positive",
