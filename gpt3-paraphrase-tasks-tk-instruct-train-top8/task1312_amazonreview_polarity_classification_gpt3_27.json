I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",
            "output": "positive",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

I have sent two emails so far with no response or refund from Amazon or the seller. Seems like theft to pay for something and never receive the product. Even the tracking information has no idea where it's at, just that it's never been delivered. Frustrated and pissed.",

She is 3.5 and a confident walker, so this is not an issue of undue pressure on the cart. The legs snapped in half. Same spot and issue as almost every other complaint. It is not worth the money saved when it is only used for 3 weeks. Either don't get a shopping cart or splurge on a better quality one. Just don't waste your money on this one!",

I couldn\u2019t believe how relatable this book is, because even tho is a fiction of the authors imagination it touches some real life stuff that you\u2019ll have to read to see what I\u2019m talking about, I love every aspect of it and can\u2019t wait what you come up with next wink wink shoulder nudge nudge \ud83d\udc9c.",
