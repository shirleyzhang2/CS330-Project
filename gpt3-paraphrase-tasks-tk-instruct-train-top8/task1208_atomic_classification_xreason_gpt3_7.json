        "You will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are described in short phrases involving participants.

The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
