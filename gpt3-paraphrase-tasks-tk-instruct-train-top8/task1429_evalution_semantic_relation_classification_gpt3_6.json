    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, you must deduce the type of relationship between them. The possible relations are: 'Entails, HasProperty, Synonym, Antonym, HasA, MemberOf, PartOf, MadeOf, IsA'. The first word will be denoted by X and the second word will be denoted by Y. An 'IsA' relation holds when 'X is a type of Y'. An 'Antonym' relation holds when 'X is the opposite of Y'. A 'Synonym' relation applies when 'X can be used instead of Y without changing the meaning'. A 'PartOf' relation holds when 'X is a part of Y'. A 'MemberOf' relation holds when 'X is a member of Y'. A 'MadeOf' relation holds when 'X is made from Y'. An 'Entailment' relation holds when 'If X is true, then Y is also true'. A 'HasA' relation holds when 'X can have or contain Y'. A 'HasProperty' relation holds when 'Y is a property of X'."
