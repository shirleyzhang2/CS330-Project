        "In this task, you will be shown a conversation and a question. Your task is to categorize the question into one or more of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, and commonsense. Matching questions are entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in the dialogue, and the answer can be extracted from that sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong in the reasoning category. Summary questions require an understanding of the whole dialogue, including the topic of the dialogue and the relationship between the speakers. Logical questions require logical reasoning to answer. Arithmetic questions require knowledge of arithmetic to answer. Commonsense questions require additional knowledge that is not provided by the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group."

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man?

You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like?

And of course when you go out, you'll wrap up warm. But inside in the houses it's always very warm, much warmer than at home.

M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there's only one hour of daylight, so you really looks forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing. But you see the summers are amazing, from May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets. It's still light in the midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper. W: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun. M: Yeah, that's right, but it's wonderful. You won't stay up all night.

W: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago. M: That's a pretty long span of time. W: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: \"Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.\" M: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell? W: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size. M: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens? W: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine? M: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters. W: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.
