        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. You have to determine whether the subject of the event needs what is mentioned in the Tail before the Head or not. Here need is a precondition for the subject to achieve the event. For example, in order for the subject to give gifts, the subject must first buy the presents. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
