Did anyone else hear cops in the audience applauding and yelling cat calls of support when their fascist in chief called for \"roughing up\" those they arrest on national tv?  I guess that's ok now too, according to the President of the United States.  Still, 86 percent of republicans still support this, love a Russian murderous president along with a president that honors a murderous Russian leader, could care less about Russian spies  compromising a US presidential election as long as it's someone that promises them things just for them is elected, talks visceral politics to thousands of 10 year old Boy Scouts on national TV, etc, etc, etc.... thanks sooo much for Senators McCain, Murowsky, and Collins.

That would save at least $700 million dollars per year.\n\nEliminate corporate welfare for Tesoro, Petrostar and Flint Hills, that saves another $50 million per year.\n\nEliminate the legislatures' annual sessions (and reduce the number of legislative staffers)- let the legislature meet once every two years.  Save another $50 million per year.\n\nDo NOT buy the Tajmahawker, save $32 million.\n\nDo not allow our oil to be removed unless Alaska takes 50 percent of the gross.  That eliminates the deficit by around $3.5 billion. (This is even less than many other countries take.)\n\nAlaska would then have a surplus by several hundred million.\n\nGrow the Permanent Fund so that future generations can enjoy what we have.",
