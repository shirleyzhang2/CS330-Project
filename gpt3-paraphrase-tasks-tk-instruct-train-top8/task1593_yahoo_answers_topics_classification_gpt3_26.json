            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

This is because they have already spent the money to get all the way through the recruiting process, and if they were to start again from scratch it might cost them an additional 20-50k to bring a different candidate into the position.  Add to this the cost to the project of having an unfilled position for a longer period than expected, and you'll find there is a pretty large margin for you to negotiate where their net costs will be lower if they acquiese to your requests.\\n\\nThe other factor is the overall job market.  In today's market, where employment is picking up in many sectors you're in a good spot to negotiate.\\n\\nNow the right place to phrase things is to describe competitive offers (hopefully you'll have some) in terms of their relative advantage.  If one of your alternative offers pays more, you can allude to this vaguely.  Even if they do not, you can allude to the relative advantages (the types of challenge, the convience of the commute etc).  This will create a more competitive landscape where your potential employer feels like they need to overcome other offers (and not that you are simply greedy and would like more cash).\\n\\nUnless the potential employer has really lowballed you (i.e. you are well below industry averages for your area), you should shoot for a modest counter-proposal of 5-15%.  Put this out there with clear timelines for when they need to respond, and other forms you might accept (signing bonus, trading-up level/rank, etc).\\n\\nYou should stay professional throughout the process, even if your offer is rejected.  Employers know that this is the right time to bring these things up, so don't worry about burning bridges by putting a request out there at this stage.\\n\\nOk.  Hope that helps!",
