The 3 attendants who were supposed to help me were more engrossed in the novels they were reading. I tried the tuxedo on and the pants were way too baggy. I knew this was not the way it was supposed to look, but the attendant said that's how they are supposed to be unless they took it in at the waist. I would have expected much better service like when I was fitted in the Phoenix location.",

But based on the taste of the food the small portions aren't a bad thing. I had the beef tacos. They were four mini beef tacos (served with no side whatsoever), the meat was extremely dry. The only way to salvage them was to dump loads of salsa and sour cream on them. I also ordered what the menu said was a pina colada I took one sip and immediately pushed it to the side (they had the courtesy to not charge me for it). All in all it was a really bad experience and I would not go there again nor recommend this place to anyone.\\nTo be avoided",

Again the waitress( a different one) was short with us and obviously in too much of a hurry to attend to our needs. But my real gripe was the glasses. They were filthy. All of them. I couldn't use them, they just put me off. The inside of the glasses had this build up of grime and dirt on them.  I won't be going to this place again.",

            "input": "I like the concept of Pita Jungle, I have just had better. Way better. The service was pretty good and it is just off of the light rail. We sat near the back where the booths are coming apart. I know they are probably going for the whole retro, artsy type vibe but I am an artist myself and I would just call it dumpy. We ordered the hummus (of course) and pita, a falafel pita, Philadelphia cheese-steak pita, and the pesto pizza.\\n\\n I was extremely disappointed by the pita when it came, a whole plate of hummus and they gave us this small, sad looking pita to go with it. For a place with pita in its moniker, you would think the pita would be the prize of the menu but it was chewy, flat and stiff. I sat there the whole time eating and thinking how much better Zorba's in Chandler is than this.  The hummus is okay and while the falafel was passable, they wrapped it in that so-so pita. The pesto pizza was good but nothing to write home about. The cheese-steak pita needed to be mopped up after but I hear it was good.\\n\\n For $28 for these items I was left feeling like we would have had a better experience and WAY more food to show for the money at Haji-Baba's in Tempe on Apache Blvd. At least I got some free 944 magazines out of it but I was hungry again two hours later.",
