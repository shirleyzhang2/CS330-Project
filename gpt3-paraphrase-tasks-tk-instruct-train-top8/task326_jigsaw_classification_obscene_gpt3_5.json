    "Definition": [
        "You are given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment into either 'obscene' or 'non-obscene'. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is taboo in polite usage."
