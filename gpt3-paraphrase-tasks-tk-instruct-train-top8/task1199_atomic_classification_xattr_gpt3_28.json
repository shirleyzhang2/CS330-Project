    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be seen as what is mentioned in the Tail. In this task, PersonX will be seen as the Tail if the Tail describes PersonX's persona or attribute as perceived by others given an event. For example, if the Head is \"PersonX gives a gift to PersonY\" and the Tail is \"PersonX is generous\", then the answer would be \"Yes\". However, if the Head is \"PersonX steals a car\" and the Tail is \"PersonX is evil\", then the answer would be \"No\". Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
