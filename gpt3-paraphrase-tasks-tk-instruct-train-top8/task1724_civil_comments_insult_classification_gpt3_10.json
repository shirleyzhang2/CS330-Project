Then pay the state 4% of the fund balance every year to be used for their operating and capital expenses. In years when the fund produces more than 6% in earnings, pay the excess earnings out to the public in the form of a dividend. Under the plan, this year the State would get approximately $2.8 billion. Of course that is short of what they want but it is sustainable into perpetuity. Continuing to build to the Permanent Fund is the Future of Alaska. We accept pain now, for the benefit of a brighter future!",

So Ellis getting 3 months for killing a person is obscene when this dude gets 15 years for 8600 dollars worth of fraud.  A human life is at least a thousand more times as valuable as $8600.  So a thousand times 15 years is 15,000 years.  That would be a sentence more appropriate for Ellis.  3 months is a freakin' joke.",
