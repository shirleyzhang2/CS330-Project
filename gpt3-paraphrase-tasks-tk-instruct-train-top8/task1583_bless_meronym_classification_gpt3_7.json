        "Given an object and a part, output 1 if the object has that part and 0 if it does not. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to output 1 if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts, and 0 if it does not. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
