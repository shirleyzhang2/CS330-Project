Maybe replace it with global representatives from the 150 or so National Conferences of Bishops representing 1.2 billion Catholics? I don't know. I haven't the answer except that it will take a long time to dismantle the Curia -- to make the unrigging successful. Bishops can do it by asserting themselves as individual national bodies, but that seems unlikely right now. Some National Conferences of Bishops, of course, are more progressive than others. In the meantime, in dealing with abuse in churches (and everywhere, really), the best route (for bringing about reform) seems to be through local civil courts, sympathetic laypeople and clerics, the press, and Pope Francis. If courts jailed a few bishops, that might help a lot, too.",

Kurgan subtly suggests that she has mental problems, has multiple personalities and stalks her posts inordinately. Kurgan is a troll without a doubt and one of the most vicious and obnoxious variety: cyber-bullying is the most apt description. \nJH is not a troll but nonetheless equally annoying in his absolute conviction that he is always right, that his intellect is superior to any intellect or authority on the planet or beyond it. That this is irrational we all know, except he.\nNeko is difficult to assess as whenever she replies, it is never germane to what one has actually written, she sidetracks by always introducing an irrelevant argument into the discussion. In a verbal debate she would be shot down in flames but in an internet thread with limited characters it is difficult to address her interventions in depth. Online she is very combative as she herself admits.",
