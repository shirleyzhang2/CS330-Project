    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is more topical with respect to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is defined to be topical if the completion maintains relevance and logical succession (i.e. stays on topic) with the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Output either 'A' or 'B'."
