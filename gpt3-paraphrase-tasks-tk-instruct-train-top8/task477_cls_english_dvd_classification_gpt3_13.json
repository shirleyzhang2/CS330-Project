As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

Sure, this series bears some [contrived] humor; How convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some regressive conservative who, with a red face, watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur Michael Moore because of his fabricated \"misrepresentations and untruths.\" I guess I'm writing this because I had the misfortune of seeing \"The Awful Truth,\" and I feel I need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until I have an aneurysm. (If I had an aneurysm, I'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the Shamu tank at Sea World. At least I could warp some kids' minds in the process of dying.)    Every episode is literally like, \"AWFUL FACT OF THE DAY: Some obscure, skewed study shows that Americans are dumb and like explosions and I'm Michael Moore an attention-starved clownboat!\" Seriously, it's interesting Moore critiques \"American Indulgence\" when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright.  - Thus Says the Pellingto",

I was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when I first heard about this one, seeing how I normally associate Tim Meadows, with flat, not very funny, comedies, when he stars, and very vague cameo and side roles in other Adam Sandler and Will Ferrel main Headliner movies!     But this one, wow! He is really a talented individual!      I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.  His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.    I also like how this movie, once again paired up Nick Nolte and Mr. Meadows, for the first time since 48 Hours!  Nothing short of brilliance, I say!  While Mr. Meadow's role was much more dramatic in Hotel Rwanda, keep in mind, he did show a sufficient amount of that \"angry black\" character he is famous for in 48 Hours.    Definitely pick up this movie!  You won't be sorry!    MC White said:  You'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up, and memorize all of the Main Character's names!  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!",

Okay he is a good actor, but once they had shaved his head, did they not see how freakishly Enormal it was? or the shine? THe original Annie was awesome, it was perfect, it didnt need a cheesy remake in the 90's.The new Annie doesnt even fit the bill, no red curly hair, which wasnt the original movies idea, it was based on the cartoon. My niece saw this one first, and then the original, and she LOVES the original even though she saw it second, she said the new one isnt \"as fun to watch\" and i agree",

She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal",

This spectacular and powerful singing and dance performance (and the excellent commentaries)telling the story of the Fire Goddess, Pele, and her sister Hiiaka, gives deep insights into Hawaiian culture and religious belief and is wonderful to watch.
