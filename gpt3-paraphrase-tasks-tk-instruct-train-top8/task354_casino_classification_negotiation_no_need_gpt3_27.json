    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). You need to output Yes if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output No. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item. It can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
