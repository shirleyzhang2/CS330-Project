I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

            "input": "Faith Hill - Selling Out To Sell Records.... . Faith Hill has been known (both celebrated and criticized) for testing the waters.  She has never \"played it safe\"...until now.    First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for \"Cry\".  \"Cry\" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  \"Lead Me On\", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.    As for \"Fireflies\", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked \"Cry\", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.      The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.      I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of \"This Kiss\" and \"Breathe\".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: \"Fireflies\" is not selling as well as \"Breathe\" and \"Faith\" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the \"I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you\" image that Faith has unveiled",

Surely not a rehash of some old Muddy Waters' and Willie Dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with Muddy's voice and band. This album was a big dud. Sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as Chess Studio in the 1940's and 50's. Unfortunatley Muddy had a better voice and so does Willie Dixon for that matter. All the session men sound like add-ons to the old band, not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing. Pretty weak effort by all, unless Sumlin is himself to blame, as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating,something that had already been created 50 years before.   One redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut, an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session. Sumlin is in need of an editor, or at least a confidant, who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes.",
