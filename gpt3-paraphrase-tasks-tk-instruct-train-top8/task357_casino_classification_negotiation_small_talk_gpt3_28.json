        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. Your task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No."
