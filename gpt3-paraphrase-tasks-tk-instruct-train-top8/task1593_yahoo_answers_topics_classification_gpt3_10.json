            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

With the understanding that both people are very passionate, the whole relationship could boil down to a competition of expression; one might try to outdue the other in showing how much they care. Depending on the people, this could come out very well, but at the same time, it could end in catastrophe. Another way it could end up going is that one of the two may feel too clouded in the other's show of passion, and feel like they need a break... thus possibly bringing the whole thing to an end. Not a common occurance, but it happens. The last thing i will mention is the more common of the 3, and by far, the best. The two people keep their display of passion limited to a certain amount. this assures that noone will feel drown out, and at the same time, neither of the two feels neglected by the other. I'm not talking about only saying \"i love you\" every 3rd wednesday or anything, those little things are ok to do whenever, but bigger things like dinner dates, trips to the movies, roses and yes, even sex, should be \"rationed\" to make sure you don't burn your candle down too fast and feel that there is nothing more really for you. \\n\\nIt is possible for any of these to happen, and with some variance, but once again, it all boils down to the types of people involved. Their other traits in their personality and their past will influence which path will occur.\\n\\n(i love your questions btw, give me more to answer, lol)",

The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\\n\\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\\n\\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\\n\\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\n\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\n\\n\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX",
