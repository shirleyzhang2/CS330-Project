        "You are given a short poem which is written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Kids in grades 1-6 will be considered as in elementary school, and kids in grades 7-12 will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output and cannot have both categories at a time."
