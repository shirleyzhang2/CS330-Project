I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

No sort of brake on the wheels so always have to lay flat. Can\u2019t prop up on condo room wall for instance. Then the true test! I try to use it to carry light weight items like towels and beach bags and it was a total fail. The product has a bigger hassle trying to wrangle around than anything! I honestly got so aggravated that I never even took it to the beach to use as a chair so I can\u2019t review that part of the products functionality. Finally with only a 30 day window to return (ordered on May 1st for a May 18th 10 day vacay) i decided to just leave the piece of crap behind rather than wrangle it back home and try to re-package and return before the deadline.
