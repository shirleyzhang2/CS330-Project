Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as Human. Quantity questions are asking about numeric values and Location questions ask about locations, cities, and countries. The answer is either \"Description\", \"Entity\", \"Abbreviation\", \"Person\", \"Quantity\", or \"Location\"."
