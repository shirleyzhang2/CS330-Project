This is not new, I believe Jay mentioned this in his biography, but he told me more than once his greatest regret as Governor was not vetoing the income tax repeal.

I suppose one can dwell on the bad too much, likewise one can choose to simply ignore that which is distasteful. I disagree on the US controlling it's behavior( in a positive way ) which I see as being a major source of destabilization in the world. There are actions that could be taken to reduce the risks, but they're not even being considered AFAIK.\n\nFortunately I don't have nightmares on this subject, yet. I do wish those in power had them though, truly I do. I can face my own end, I just hope I'm not around if (I think more likely when) the unthinkable happens. That's too depressing, think I'll go watch \"On The Beach\" to cheer me up . :)",
