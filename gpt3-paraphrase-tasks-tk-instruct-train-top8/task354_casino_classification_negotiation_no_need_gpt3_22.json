        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, which implies that the item is up for grabs."
