            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke. Following World War II, this artist produced such collections as Mormon Villages and The Irish Countryman, and her report with her husband Paul Taylor led to her employment by Roy Stryker, who had hired Esther Bubley for similar reasons. Her work was used in an exhibit on Executive Order 9066, but she remains better known for a work whose title figure remained unknown for forty years until she identified herself as Florence Owens Thompson, a portrait produced as the result of her hiring by the Farm Security Administration. For ten points, identify this photographer who produced some of the most famous images of the Great Depression, including Migrant Mother.",
            "output": "Literature",
            "explanation": "Although an artist might contribute to literature, going further through text shows that the mentioned artist is a painter, so the correct label is fine arts."

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",

            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."
