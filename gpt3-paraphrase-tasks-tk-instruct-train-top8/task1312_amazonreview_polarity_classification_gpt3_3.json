I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",

I cannot get a hold of someone in product support to find out if something can be done about it.

That being said I noticed problems before the dog even saw the ball. For one, they use a metal washer to keep the string tied onto the ball. Be sure to remove that first before you give it to your dog or run the risk that your dog cracks a tooth and undergoes a painful (and pricy) surgery to have that corrected. When I took out the washer I double and eventually triple knotted the knot at the bottom to keep it in the ball. The dog just has to pull a little and the string pulls right through the ball and you have no handle on your dog or the toy.",

As you can see in the picture I posted my Glutathione level was low (first number), so my doctor told me to begin a supplement. The first one I chose was the acetyl version which was pricey, but raised my levels up (the second number). I wanted to continue to raise my numbers up, but also wanted to save some money so I decided to try this brand because it has a high dose of Glutathione, but as you can see by my lab results (third number) my numbers plummeted even lower than they were before! I stopped taking this once I saw this cause I have no idea what\u2019s really in this product, but it\u2019s not Glutathione.",
