        "You are given a paragraph, event and an entity. The event is part of the given paragraph and it changes the state of the entity. The three possible states of the entity are: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location and 3) known location. \"not exist\" means the entity doesn't exist in that state anymore. \"unknown location\" means the entity exists in that state but location is unknown. \"known location\" means the entity exists and location is known. Your task is to classify the state of the entity into one of the three classes."
