            "input": "boring.... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).

They are also great for power napping or doing creative work.  I feel that the Awakened Mind System discs are better than many of Thompson's other discs for two reasons.  First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.  Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating.  If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System",

Unlike some of the other \"Mondo\" albums, this collection may not be representative of the breadth and depth of Indian music, but it makes for great listening all the same.  \"Mondo Asian\" features primarily the polished, intricately textured compositions of R.A. Rahman, billed as \"India's greatest contemporary film composer\".  The CD cover continues: \"By incorporating western production styles and sensibilities to Indian traditions, Rahman has created a music that is universal even as it is distinctly Indian.\"  Traditional Indian instruments and vocal techniques merge with western harmonies and structures to create compositions that are as fascinating as they are fun. Especially striking are the hypnotic track #11, \"Gropika Poornima\", and track #8, the mysterious and sinuous \"Suno Re\", which was written by Rahman's student, Vishal",
