    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are described in short phrases involving participants. The specific names of people have been replaced with generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine whether it is plausible for the Head to desire the Tail. In this task, desire means desires of sentient entities. For example, if a doctor desires to cure a patient, the answer would be classified as \"Yes\". If the phrase contains \"___\", it is a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
