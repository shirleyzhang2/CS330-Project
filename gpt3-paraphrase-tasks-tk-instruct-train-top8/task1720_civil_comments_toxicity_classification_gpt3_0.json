            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "input": "Apologies. Her name is Hasselberger. As far as I can tell, she will neither be in Guam or a part of the proceedings.",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

She was charged with \"failing to render assistance\" (!) and sentenced to 18 months.  Do blondes have more fun?  They apparently get away with vehicular manslaughter of Yup'ik people!\n\n02/06/13--17 year-old Murphy Gross got high, stole daddy's SUV and T-boned another car, killing young mother of two Catherine Cope.  He got 8 months--the Judge felt he could be 'rehabilitated'.  Translation, he was white and Cope wasn't.\n\n07/19/14--17 year-old drunk driver Alexandra Ellis ran down 51 year-old bicyclist Jeff Dusenbury, killed him and fled.  The victim was white this time, but so was Ellis' daddy.  And he was a well-connected lawyer.  She got a year.\n\n03/12/16--26 year-old Native man Arnold Demboski, driving a snowmobile drunk, struck and killed a DOG. The Magistrate characterized his actions as '...an act of terrorism,\" a potentially capital crime.\n\nTHIS is why we need fewer white judges.",
