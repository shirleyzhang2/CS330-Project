        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: identity-attack and non-identity-attack. Identity attack refers to anything rude or disrespectful about someone's identity, including appearance, race, gender, and sexual orientation. Non-identity-attack means anything else."

The number of Afrikaans-speakers have been growing (which those types in the picture conveniently ignores because non-white Afrikaans speakers now outnumber white ones) - but noooo, let's claim victimhood because it doesn't get treated as if it's the only language that should be spoken in South Africa (when in reality it's still only the third most spoken language).\n\nReally. Instead of pretending to be the \"master race\", maybe a large portion of white people in this country could actually start using what is situated in-between their ears. That would be nice.",

I read your posts often enough to know that you are indeed an enlightened gentleman who would never say \"We are in a war with selfish, foolish & narcissistic rich people\" --- except to excoriate that sentiment.  And yes, it should be excoriated.  The left is bent toward what they always have been --- overturning the social order for the purpose of taking what you own. They are now using low-level violence to get it.  We are just past the nascent stages of a quiet revolution.  As the left becomes more intolerant of free expression, they shut it down with violence.  That is happening now.  They will become more intolerant, and more violent, but they do not want a bloody civil war.  They're waiting for us to get used to the idea that the America we loved is gone.  Then it will be complete, bloodless.",
