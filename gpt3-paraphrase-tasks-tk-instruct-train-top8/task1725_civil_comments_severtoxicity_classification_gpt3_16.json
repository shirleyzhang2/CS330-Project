            "input": "The concept of waste heat being beneficial is a red herring for a large part.  A 60W bulb generates 3.3 BTU of heat per watt or ~200 BTU total.  The best generators are 25% - 30% efficient so your 60 watt bulb requires 600 BTU worth of diesel fuel to power.  A 60 watt equivalent LED uses 10 watts/33 BTU total so requires ~100 Diesel BTU's to generate.  A decent diesel stove is 80+% efficient making it the heat source of choice.  Moreover, LED's by dint of less demand allow a smaller generating capacity or allow for an entire engine to be shut down if  the efficiencies in a community are scaled.  They also have proportionally less line loss from generator to bulb, aka distribution loss.  We were able to downsize a cabin from a 2kw Honda to a 1kw unit by converting first to CFL's then LED's with the bonus of being able to run an electric coffee pot with a few lights!",

It toke almost 90 days just to get that out of them. Is it that hard to compromise, the saving account ( CBR ) is there take it FOOLS !  Then go home and explain to your constituents that you did your job.... end of story... Let the Governor do his job. Is he going to say you screwed up taking the Revenue from the CBR to pay for his wants and the Legislators... I don't think so let him cry if he wants, he didn't get to raid the PFD / PF like he would have done with your help, Big Deal there is always next year.. At least a few of you Legislators mite get re-elected as a result.  Good that some don't come back!",
