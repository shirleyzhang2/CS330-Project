        "The task is to classify whether a given medical case report extracted from MEDLINE mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. An adverse drug reaction is defined as a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from the use of a medical product. Classify your answers into 'non-adverse drug event' and 'adverse drug event'."
