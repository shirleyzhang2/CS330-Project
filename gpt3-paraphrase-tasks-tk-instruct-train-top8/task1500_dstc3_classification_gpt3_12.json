    "Definition": [
        "The input is a conversation between an automated system and a user looking for suggestions for pubs, restaurants and coffee shops in Cambridge. In the dialogue, the user may provide some criteria for the type of place they want such as price range, cuisine, etc. Given such a dialogue, output the price range the user is looking for which can take one of four values: Cheap, Moderate, Expensive and Don't Care. Output cannot be any other value than the four values. Note that if the user asks for the prices of items provided at a pub, restaurant or coffee shop but doesn't mention the price range they are looking for then the correct classification will be Don't Care. If the user does not mention a particular price, the correct classification will be Don't Care."
