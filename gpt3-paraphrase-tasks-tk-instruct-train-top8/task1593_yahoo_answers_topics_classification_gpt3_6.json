            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

The resulting fat is similar to\nsaturated fat, which raises \"bad\" LDL cholesterol\nand can lead to clogged arteries and heart\ndisease. \\nUntil very recently, food labels were\nnot required to list trans fats, and this health\nrisk remained hidden to consumers. In early July,\nFDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon\nbegin identifying trans fat content in processed\nfoods.",

You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture.  There are particular models of Gibson & Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a \"chromatic tailpiece\".  I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\\n\\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious \"soapbar\" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then).",
