I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I have noticed since I started wearing it that occasionally my iphone screen will go black out of no where or right after I unlock the screen. I think the magnet in the band has been causing issues with the phone making it inconvenient. Also, if you do any sort of lifting or carrying of objects, I've noticed that the clasp will easily be knocked off center of the band making me worried that it might fall off after getting loose.",
