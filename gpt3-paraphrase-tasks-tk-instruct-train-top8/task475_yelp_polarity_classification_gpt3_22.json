            "input": "I really wish I could give this place a few more stars considering how much money we spent there.  We came here for the foie gras but were told that it's no longer on the menu.  Given that we were all starving we decided to start with a bunch of appetizers.   Besides the stuffed dates, the appetizers warn't very good.  We kept ordering more and more tapas hoping to get wowed, but everything  that came out was mediocre.  Our final dish was the paella, and we hardly touched it, it was more like a jambalaya than anything else.  Finally it came time for dessert and we ordered the chocolate lava cake and the fruits.  The chocolate lava cake was amazing but the fruits made us all giggle.  It was a bowl of pretty much all apples with some whip cream on top.  I don't know, I guess we all expected a little bit more considering it was in Aria and it was highly rated on Yelp",

I was a manager for them in 2003-2005 and even though the layout of the second floor has changed the delicious creations in the kitchen have not.\\n\\nWe started off with the queso/ chorizo appetizer. It was so scrumptious that it was gone before we knew it. I had the pina coloda with toasted coconut. Wow what a drink. I love the chicken quesadilla, something I crave! You can not beat the fresh hand made tortillas of Border Grill. We also shared the Border Grill Classics. I wanted my husband to taste the well balanced flavors of the empanada and the sweet corn tamale. They were just as if  had tasted them in the years of my employment.\\n\\nThank you Border Grill Mary and Susan. I loved working for you and your flavorful fare did not disappoint and impressed that of my beloved.",
