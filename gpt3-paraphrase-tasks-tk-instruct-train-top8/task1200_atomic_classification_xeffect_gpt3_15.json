        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX will be affected as mentioned in the Tail or not. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
