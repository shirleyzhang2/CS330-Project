Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the \"Previous\" button pressed in \"hold\" mode while connecting the cable to laptop.",
