        "You will be given a piece of text, and you will need to output \"yes\" if the text contains any abusive content, or \"no\" if it does not. We consider content to be abusive if it contains any of the following: 1. Identity Directed Abuse: this is when the content contains a negative statement against an identity. An identity is a social category that relates to a fundamental aspect of individuals community, socio-demographics, position or self-representation. 2. Affiliation Directed Abuse: this is when the content expresses negativity against an affiliation. An affiliation is a voluntary association with a collective. Affiliations include but are not limited to: memberships (e.g. Trade unions), party memberships (e.g. Republicans), political affiliations (e.g. Right-wing people) and occupations (e.g. Doctors). 3. Person Directed Abuse: this is when the content directs negativity against an identifiable person, who is either part of the conversation thread or is named. Person-directed abuse includes serious character based attacks, such as accusing the person of lying, as well as aggression, insults and menacing language. 4. Counter Speech: this is when the content challenges, condemns or calls out the abusive language of others."
