        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into two classes: 'disagree' or 'agree'. Classify the comment as 'disagree' if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement. The disagreement can be due to toxic content, controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as 'agree' otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

We are asked here to ensure our speech is CIVIL. When it is not considered CIVIL it is removed. Using ones Facebook page for a platform to make racist comments can lead to consequences far greater than just having such comments removed. This young girl has lost the trust of many and has positioned herself undesirably to many of us regardless of the official outcome of all of this. She is now just a reminder of what Canada might become in the future. I suspect that is not what many of us want.",

The reason he is calling another special session is because the illegally gerrymandered super majority of GOPers who control the legislature wasted away the regular session, the 30 extra days and then the 30 days of special session. Either they are incompetent or just intentionally not doing the sole job they have to do which is balance the budget. The Governor gave them a balanced set of proposals that would have done the job for them but they like you are bound by pig headed ideological opposition to anything Walker proposes because he is not Parnell. Trying to shift blame for your parties inability to do their job onto the Governor is the direct opposite of assuming personal responsibility for your actions that use to be a cornerstone of conservative beliefs. What happened to those ethics Dick, that taking personal responsibility for your actions?",

No one is better at spending other people's money than smug leftwing idealists in the Federal Liberals.  Trudeau is a naive idealist who grew up with a silver spoon completely disconnected from the economic realities facing most Canadian families. The Federal Liberals ignorantly believe they are better at spending taxpayer money than the people who actually earn it, they support big government, waste, and leftwing social experiments that waste money and yield nothing in return. Sunny ways, because it's 2016, #whatwouldJustindo, good for you Canada! And the government will run exclusively on \"green\" energy by 2025, because wind and solar have done wonders for Ontario... good for you Toronto, you deserve each other.",

Faith based organizations provide important services to our society and they are to be commended for doing so. It simply does not follow that just because a faith based institution refuses to provide something that is contrary to that faith that in turn it should be forced out of business entirely and in the process punish those who receive the much needed other services provided by the institution. That would be perverse.",
