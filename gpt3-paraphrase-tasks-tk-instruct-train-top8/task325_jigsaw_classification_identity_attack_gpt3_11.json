Let me relate a short anecdote....it was about Bush, but it's even more appropriate for Trump.\n\nI was using the \"Buck's\" outhouse at the Cardlock Service Station where I buy gas.  Written on the wall was \"If you're poor enough to be using this crapper and you thing Bush really cares about you,  you are really, really stupid.\"  Trump won with millions of votes from white working-class voters who simply voted against their own self-interest.  As that graffiti so succinctly put it, IMO, that was an ill-considered (that's PC for stupid) thing to do.  \n\nWe now have an administration dedicated to Laissez Faire capitalism.....Gordon Gekko \"greed is good\" style, unfettered free market capitalism.   IMO, Trump, as a \"card carrying\" sociopath, will use racism, just as any other prejudice, as a tool to achieve his end.  Concern for all Americans is a moral stance,  sociopaths are amoral.

I'd hazard a guess that many of the \"offended\" don't stand at attention with their hands over their hearts while watching the games at home.",
