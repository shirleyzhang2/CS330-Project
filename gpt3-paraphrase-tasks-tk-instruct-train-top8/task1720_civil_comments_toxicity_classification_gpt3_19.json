Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",

            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

Look at Juneau, every single elected representative deserves to be thrown out. But it will never happen because voters, no matter how much they complain, don't want to give up a single thing.\n\nLook at the outcry over freezing state employees pay, you would think that some are going to be forced into poverty by the reactions. Same with ending corporate welfare to oil companies, or the state subsidizing GCI's profits. People act like by ending, or at least scaling back the amount, is going to make the state fail.\n\nWe are going to be in a world of hurt because of  people  who cling to their own self interests.",

It is not like the cops didn't know that people were going to be able to get a jug for $20 (bootleg price was like $40 before the store).  Why did they spend all the money to investigate a crime which in the very near future was going to be a non issue?  There is a liquor store down the road selling untold jugs every day.\n\nA reasonable person might think that in Bethel and the surrounding area, cops might have something better to do.  Think of this next time public safety screams about budget cuts;  wasting money and crying for more.",

The force is better for it.

It's probably smart of them to get out before the melting permafrost collapses all our roads and communities. Before our fisheries die off from ocean acidification and rising temperatures.
