        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to output \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time, and \"No\" otherwise. We say a verb can be anchored in the real timeline if it happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."
