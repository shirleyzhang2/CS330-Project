        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains irony. You must classify the type of irony the tweet has. The tweet can be classified as \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\" based on the irony it contains. \"Polarity\" irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. \"Other\" is for ironies that are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
