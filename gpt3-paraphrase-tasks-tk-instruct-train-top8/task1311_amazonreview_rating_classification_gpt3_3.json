I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

The material is that paper-like itchy material, it's not long or flowey like the model, the sleeves are this weird Shakespeare-like resemblance, it's clearly not a legit company that makes this dress but rather a knock-off somewhere in China. I should've paid attention to the reviews. Take my advice and avoid because the company will Not refund all your money. \n Rating: 1",
