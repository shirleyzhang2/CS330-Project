        "In this task, you will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The self-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation. For example, a participant might point out that they sweat a lot to show preference towards water packages."

'Yes, it would.' 'I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?'\nUtterance: 'You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.'",

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
