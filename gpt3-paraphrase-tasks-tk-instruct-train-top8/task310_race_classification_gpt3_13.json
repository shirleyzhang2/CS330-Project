            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.

Many people liked to listen to him talk because he liked to tell some interesting stories to make people laugh all the time. One day Mark Twain was going to a small town because of his writing. Before he was going to leave, one of his friends said to him that there were always a lot of mosquitoes  in the town and told him that he'd better not go there. Mark Twain waved   his hand and said, \"It doesn't matter. The mosquitoes are no relatives of mine. I don't think they will come to visit me.\" After he arrived at the town, Mark Twain stayed in a small hotel near the station. He went into his room, but when he was just about to have a rest, quite a few mosquitoes flew about him. The waiters felt very sorry about that. \"I'm very sorry, Mr. Mark Twain. There are too many mosquitoes in our town.\" One of them said to him. Mark Twain, however, made a joke, saying to the waiter, \"The mosquitoes are very clever. They know my room number. They didn't come into the wrong room.\" What he said made all the people present laugh heartily. But that night Mark Twain slept well. Do you know why?

Sadeh and his colleagues found an extra hour of sleep can make a big difference. The children who slept longer, although they woke up more frequently during the night, scored higher on tests, Sadeh reported in the March/April issue of journal Child Development. \"When the children slept longer, their sleep quality was somewhat weak, but in spite of this their performance for study improved because the extra sleep was more significant than the reduction in sleep quality. \" Sadeh said. \"Some studies suggested that lack of sleep as a child affects development into adulthood and it's more likely to develop their attention disorder when they grow older. \" In earlier studies, Sadeh's team found that fourth graders slept an average of 8. 2 hours and sixth graders slept an average of 7. 7 hours. \"Previous research has shown children in elementary school need at least nine hours of sleep a night on a regular basis, said Carl Hunt, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research in Bethesda, and high-school-age children need somewhat less, he said, adding the results of insufficient sleep could be serious. \"A tired child is an accident waiting to happen,\" Hunt said. \"And as kids get older, toys get bigger and the risks higher. \"Hunt also said too little sleep could result in learning and memory problems and long-term effects on school performance. \"This is an important extension of what we already know, \" Hunt said of Sadeh's research, adding sleep is as important as nutrition  and exercise to good health. \"To put it into reality,\" Hunt said, \"parents should make sure they know when their children actually are going to sleep and their rooms are conducive to sleeping instead of playing. \" \n Question: Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? \n Options: (A) There are some daily struggles between parents and children because of having nothing in common with extra rest time.

He wrote it in two weeks, and after a few changes, it was accepted by the Congress. As a result, he became famous. Born in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, a brilliant student at school and almost talented lawyer later, was much interested in politics. Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia in 1779, and he was sent to France as the representative of the American government in 1784. Sixteen years later, at the age of 57, he was elected president after Washington and Adams. Far from a handsome man, he was tall with long arms and big hands. Jefferson, who was an amusing talker in conversation but a poor speaker, was generally good-natured. Jefferson was regarded as a defender of freedom on America. As a president, he protected the right of free speech. Interestingly enough, in his eight years as President, Jefferson never vetoed a bill which Congress had passed. He did a lot in organizing the new University of Virginia.

The effects of such a change in climate on the human population of the world would be amazing. Recent research suggests that the general warming trend of the past hundred years or so may be coming to an end. During the past ten years, meteorologists tell us the average temperature of the earth has dropped about one degree Fahrenheit. This does not seem like much, but it could have effects on wind and rain patterns which influence the overall weather picture. If these patterns change a lot, it could mean that certain regions of the world may continue to have long droughts while others will possibly suffer from widespread flooding.  What regulates the climate is not exactly known. Meteorologists believe that clouds may be an important factor in regulating the amount of solar heat held by the earth, which in turn determines the temperature of the planet. Another possibility is that man's industrial and agricultural methods may be affecting the natural weather patterns. However, the weather is not understood well enough for scientists to say for certain what is happening to the climate and what side effects this will actually have on the world's population. \n Question: According to the text, the climate of the world seems to   _  . \n Options: (A) be getting colder (B) be getting warmer (C) remain the same in the past ten years (D) have good effects on the world's population \n Asnwer: A",
