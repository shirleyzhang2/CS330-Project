You promoted the idea that children are sissies if they can't take pain.\n\nI simply counter pointed that with the fact that physical pain is not a gauge of anything and if you want to call kids sissies for not wanting to get hurt. \n\nThis while the adult population of this countries is undergoing a rash of adults hooked on opiate pain killers, because you know, adults use medicine to take care of and manage their pain, but lets not do that for children cause we don't want them soft. Right?\n\nJust because we as a society don't agree with the idea of children in pain doesn't make us wussies or sissies or wimps or whatever name you have poised on your tongue to call us. It means we care about children and want them to have a better life than us, and if it is one filled with less pain, I do not see how that is a bad thing.
