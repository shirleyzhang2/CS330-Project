        "In this task, you are given a conversation between a flight agent and the customer. Your task is to select the goal of the conversation from 4 options. The options are `book`, `cancel`, `no_flight`, and `no_reservation`. `book` means the customer wants to make a new reservation. `cancel` means the customer wants to cancel an existing reservation. `no_flight` means the customer's preference cannot be found in the flight schedule. `no_reservation` means the conversation is mostly enquiring details and no reservation/change/cancellation was made."
