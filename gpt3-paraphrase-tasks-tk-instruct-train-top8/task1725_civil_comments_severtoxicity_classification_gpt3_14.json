Nothing that Springfield did just now, including the weird and massively expensive roundabouts project that suddenly is reversing a long held City policy not to confiscate private ownership in Glenwood through immanent domain has any meaningful public input or accountability. The consolidation happening is something that is being fast-tracked and pushed and is not spontaneously occurring from the economics of the situation or the economic good of the city or Glenwood.  And, as a diversion, all this activity and private investment positioning is being fronted by a showcase CLT parking lot that purports to revitalize a timber economy that someone needs to acknowledge is not going to return anytime soon.  At least Kitty Piercy cannot do things like this in a vacuum and I hope Eugene locates its new city hall by \"recycling\" the EWEB building at the river.  A truly \"carbon neutral\" choice.",

Unfortunately reason must battle this biological urge to simply agree with one another. Reason begins with disagreement as we posses an inability to say what the truth is and thus are left to disprove everything and accept the truth - or the closest we can get to it - is whatever is left. Analytical deduction- the basis of science and reason. \n\nDeliberation, engagement, and the boldness to disagree- what is missing in america today. PSU is socialist if they shut this down, but they don't deny this, in fact they spread flyers around campus advertising it. This school in many ways trains people to simply do what they are told and to fit into the surrounding area rather than think for themselves and to shape it.",

Not enough bullits, and not enough guns. The Gay Mayor, and his pee pee puffing police department, always shown best own the street. Too stupid to find work at Dunkin Donuts, apply with the City, Imbeciles Inbreeding, as a requirement of Seattle Police Procedure. Murder as a official policy, judge jury and executioner, all wrapped up in the Gay Mayors office.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt1mFQG3tJg",
