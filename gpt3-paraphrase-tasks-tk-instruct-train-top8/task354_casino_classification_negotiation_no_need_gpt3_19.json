        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is cooperative and used when a participant points out that they do not need an item, based on personal context. For example, suggesting that they have ample water to spare. no-need can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
