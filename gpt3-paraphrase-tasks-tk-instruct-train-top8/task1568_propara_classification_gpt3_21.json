        "In this task, you are given a paragraph, an event, and an entity. The event is part of the paragraph and changes the state of the entity. Your task is to classify the state of the entity into three classes: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location, and 3) known location. \"Not exist\" means the entity doesn't exist in that state anymore. \"Unknown location\" means the entity exists in that state but location is unknown. \"Known location\" means the entity exists and location is known."
