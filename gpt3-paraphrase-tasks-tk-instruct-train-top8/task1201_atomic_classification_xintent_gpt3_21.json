        "Given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, your task is to determine whether The Tail is the intention of the PersonX from the Head or not. The intention is the likely intent or desire of PersonX behind the execution of an event. For example, given the Head PersonX gives PersonY gifts, an intention might be that PersonX wanted to be thoughtful. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
