    "Definition": [
        "For a given prompt, select the completion from a language model that is most similar in style to the prompt. Style is defined as the overall tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure of the prompt-completion pair. If the prompt is colloquial, then the completion should also be colloquial, as opposed to a completion that is encyclopedic or overly formal. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
