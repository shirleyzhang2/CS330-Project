We can cherry pick examples all day long but I will not jump on this bigoted train with you that there is really a \"left vs right\" battle going on that we all must pick sides. It's divisive and makes one blind to the issues on their own \"side\". \n\nThis is what I see going on right now: the left and the right are failing Americans. I may be more liberal than you on social issues but that doesn't make me \"pro democrats\". I shouldn't have to point out issues with the Republican party. Instead of people coming together to decide how to fix it and make a country that works for all of us BOTH sides are involved in this stupid bigoted finger-pointing. I'm honestly sick and tired of anyone that says either \"yeah but liberals\" or \"yeah but conservatives\". What about \"yeah but what can we do to fix it?\" instead of stick our heads in the sand and point fingers at each other all day?",
