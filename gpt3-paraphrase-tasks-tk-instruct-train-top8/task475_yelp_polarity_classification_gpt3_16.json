They were being loud, a lot of cursing and shouting, many doors brig slammed. And this occurred in the room (which was next to mine) and in the hallway. It went on until late at night (4 am)\\nI felt unsafe and not comfortable calling security. I should. Retaliation was my main concern. I expressed my discontent this morning and manager gave me the possibility if late check out, which was nice considering my flight is schedule to depart at 6 pm. All and all it was good, however I would recommend to ANY hotel that have guests that are prone to kiss behave and not obey the rules to either NOT have anyone stay in t contiguous room (or on the floor at all) or to warn them prior to checking them in.",

My taste buds and tummy agree.  \\n\\nIt's a good go-to, for anything from dinner to brunch; date or large group outing.\\nMy staples for whenever I visit: beer battered bacon, cheese curds and the fresh berry napoleon. If you get a chance, check out the weekend brunch. They have a killer strawberry french toast entree that is to die for. \\n\\nPrices are a little on the higher end, relative to a college student's budget but overall, not too expensive. Staff is friendly, accommodating, and fast. The only downside is, it can get pretty crowded, especially during dinner/weekends/special occasions, so make sure to make reservations!",

After having the most epic bachelorette celebration the night before, it was necessary for us to refuel for the trip back to Cali. Since we were staying at the Signature and couldn't bear to mission it anywhere else for brunch, we decided to go to the buffet at MGM. It was awesome that were no lines and we were immediately seated. \\nThough I was definitely hurting from the 6 bottles of drank that we killed the night before, I managed to appreciate the quality of the brunch selections. I loved how I was able to satisfy my hangoverness with different plates of breakfast and lunch items. Overall, if you're in the MGM and looking for a variety of things to eat then definitely check this buffet out.",
