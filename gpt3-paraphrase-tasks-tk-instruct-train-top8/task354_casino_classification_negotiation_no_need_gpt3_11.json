    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). You are to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, and 'No' if it does not. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, such as suggesting that they have ample water to spare. It can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
