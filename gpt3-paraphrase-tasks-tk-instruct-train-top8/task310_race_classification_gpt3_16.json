            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

            "explanation": "It is clearly mentioned in the article that to the check effect of mood on children is the main purpose of the experiment. Hence, B is the correct answer and output is Yes."

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.

The Food and Drug Administration also says it found no risks in meat and milk from cloned animals. The F.D.A. looked at studies for several years before it announced its decision in a final report this month. The United States Department of Agriculture supported the findings. But it says time is needed to clear the way for marketing meat and milk from clones. The F.D.A. will not require any product to be registered  as coming from clones. A producer would need to label   a product \"clone-free\". The agency   says that could be misunderstood because the food is not different from other food. But activists argue that the F.D.A. based its decision on incomplete research into possible risks. The Center for Food Safety criticized the use of studies supplied by cloning companies. Animal rights activists point out that cloning attempts often fail. They say cloning is cruel and can lead to suffering. Congress   has been trying to get the F.D.A. to do more studies. But the agency noted that experts in New Zealand and the European Union had come to the same findings about the safety of food from clones. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan say they want to study it further before taking action. Products from cloning may not be widely used for several years. Clones cost much , which is why they are not widely used for feeding. The Agriculture Department says few clones will ever become food. Their traditionally raised animals would enter the food supply instead. \n Question: What is the best title for this passage? \n Options: (A) Is Food from Cloned Animals Safe?

            "input": "Article: In 1883, a creative engineer named John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a great bridge connecting New York with  the Long Island. However, bridge building experts thought that this was an impossible project and told Roebling to forget it. But Roebling could not ignore the vision of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an engineer, that the bridge could be built. The father and son developed concepts of how it could be completed and how the difficulties could be overcome. After that, they began to build their dream bridge. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway   a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was also injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage,which made him unable to walk or talk or even move. Everyone had a negative comment since the Roeblings were the only one who knew how to build the bridge. In spite of these difficulties, Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge. It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could do was to move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving it, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. The project was underway again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory to the victory of one man's determination not to be defeated by circumstances. This is one of the best examples of a neversaydie attitude that overcomes a terrible physical disability and achieves an impossible goal. \n Question: When John Roebling had the idea of building the bridge,   _  . \n Options: (A) his son supported him immediately (B) many experts thought it impossible (C) there was no bridge around New York (D) he persuaded the government to support him \n Asnwer: B",

Before I could make the call, I saw a woman walking out of the \" Quickie Mart\" building, then suddenly she slipped on some ice and fell down, so I got out to see if she was okay. When I got there, it looked like she had been overcome by weep than that she had fallen; she was a young woman who looked  _ with dark circles under her eyes. She dropped something as I helped her up, and I picked it up and gave it to her. It was a coin. At that moment, everything came into focus for me: the crying woman, the ancient Suburban  packed full of stuff and three kids in the back, and the gas pump reading $4.95. I asked her if she was okay and if she needed help, and she just kept saying \"I don't want my kids to see me crying,\" so we stood at the other side of the pump from her car. She said she was driving to California for Christmas and that things were very hard for her right now. I took out my credit card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so that she could fill up her car completely, and I bought two big bags of food for her kids in the car who attacked it like wolves. While it was fueling, she asked, \"So, are you an angel or something?\" I said, \"At this time of year, angels are really busy, so sometimes God uses common people.\" It was unbelievable to be part of someone else's miracle.

Wearing dirty sneakers and a shirt with holes, Don Robinson is an 81-year-old Missouri businessman. Although he's rich, he didn't use his money to buy himself a grand home. Instead, he used it to buy wild land. Robinson has decided to donate 843 acres of his own personal _ to the Department of Natural Resources after his death, which can then be used to create a new state park. His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years. How did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air. Robinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk. He said he didn't care how much his donation was worth. Tom Pounders who used to work for Robinson said, \"He doesn't think material objects are important.\" He also recalled that Robinson once repaired a broken tennis shoe with a spare tire. Robinson has just one request for the new park that will be established after his death. He'd like it to be named the Don Robinson State Park. \"There's a lot of Robinsons, but only one me. It would be nice if people remembered to use my full name when walking through the park,\" he said. \n Question: Don Robinson has decided to donate   _   to the Department of Natural Resources after his death. \n Options: (A) a green park (B) a big wooden house (C) 843 acres of land (D) all his money \n Asnwer: C",

Andaleeb's parents, sisters, best friends and close  s painted a picture of a quiet and soft-spoken woman who had not given a hint of her intentions.        But Andaleeb spoke of her plan in a video taken before Friday's bombing and shown on Saturday on the Qatar-based Arab satellite TV channel AI-Jazeera.        \"I've chosen to say with my body what Arab's leaders have failed to say.\" Said Andaleeb, repeating a frequent complaint by Palestinians that Arab nations are not doing enough againstIsrael.        \"My body is a barrel of gunpowder that burns the enemy.\" she said, reading from a piece of paper.        \"She was like any other girl of her age. She spoke about love and marriage. I am so sad she's gone. It's the shock of my life.\" said her best friend and coworker Laila Mahmoud.        A school dropout, Andaleeb had supported her family from a job at a Palestinian-owned textile factory in the nearby town ofBelt Jala.

On September 22nd, Guinness World Records listed \"Gangnam Style\" as the most-liked video in the history of YouTube. It's been performed at West Point (West-Point Style), and Google's CEO, has done the \"Gangnam Style\" horse dance at the company's office in Seoul. Even Samsung is trying to make Psy the new model for the latest type of fridge. The song's global popularity is such that the vast majority of people who enjoy it don't speak Korean, and have no idea what it is about. That's fine --- part of what makes \"Gangnam Style\" so fun is, like international pop music, the difficulty in understanding it. When we sing along, \"Hey, sexy lady\", we don't really know what we're singing about. The joy of _ is familiar to anyone who loves pop music from elsewhere. Anthony Lane, in his 2010 review of the Eurovision Song Contest, Only Mr. God Knows Why, used \"Eurovision English\" as one of its chief pleasures. It's \"a complex tongue, spoken nowhere else, which raises the heartfelt poetry   but absolute nonsense to a level of what sci-fi writers could only have dreamed. \" In similar ways, \"Gangnam Style\" is just an over-the-top video where a fat man does a funny dance and sings repetitive words that don't make sense to most of us. But on the other, the magic of the song also lies in its funny dance, which reflects not just cultural morals specific to Korea, but cultural values easily recognizable to western viewers. This song's words may be in Korean, but its scenes are in clear American. The dance moves are simple enough to copy. Nonsense, in other words, forces us to let down our guards. It makes us relax, and asks us to let in all sorts of feelings from which, otherwise, we might distance ourselves. \"Gangnam Style\" happens to be so interesting because of its incomprehensibleness. \n Question: Some complex languages are used in pop music because   _  . \n Options: (A) singers regard it as one of the chief pleasures at the concert (B) they make the music hard to understand but poetic and attractive (C) the music can sound more pleasant and beautiful to the audience (D) people like listening to the music which makes special sense to them \n Asnwer: C",

As a result, about 300 million children around the world go barefoot. Those children risk picking up diseases and parasites from the soil. An American man may have a solution for those barefoot kids -- a shoe that grows with the child. Kenton Lee is the creator of The Shoe That Grows. He explains how the shoe works and how it is able to last so long. \"It grows in three places: the front; it can also grow on the side with Velcro; and on the back with our buckle. It can last up to five years. The bottom is compressed rubber like tire rubber. The top is just high-quality leather.\" The shoe comes in two sizes: small that fits children aged 4 to 9 and large for children aged 9 to 14. Lee says he got the idea for the shoe while working as a volunteer in an orphanage in Kenya. \"... and there was a little girl in a white dress walking next to me. And I just remember looking down and seeing how small her shoes were. They were just way too small for her feet. They were so small that she had to cut open the front of her shoes to let her toes stick out. And I just remember thinking, wouldn't it be nice if there were a pair of shoes that could grow with her feet?\" However, Lee says it was not easy to turn his idea into a reality. \"I kept writing down I should do this because of this or because of that. All these reasons why it really was important for me to try to make the shoes that could grow and try to help.\" Finally, in 2009 Lee founded a non-profit organization called Because International. In the office of Because International, Lee keeps a pair of his own shoes to help him remember his promise. \"I told myself I would not get new shoes until the idea was done. So, those are the shoes that I wore for a little over five years.\" \n Question: Which of the following is the characteristic of the newly invented shoes? \n Options: (A) They are more expensive.
