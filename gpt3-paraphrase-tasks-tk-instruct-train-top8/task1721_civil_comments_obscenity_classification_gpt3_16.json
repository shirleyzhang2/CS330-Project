An explanation which you seemed to understand as you changed your question from \"what does X party stand for\" to \"what does an independent stand for.\"\n\nAs to your new question: Is that not the point of being an independent?  For each candidate to stand for what he or she individually believes in rather than what a party believes in?  If you are honestly interested in knowing what each independent candidate stands for why are you asking here and not asking the independent candidate himself?",
