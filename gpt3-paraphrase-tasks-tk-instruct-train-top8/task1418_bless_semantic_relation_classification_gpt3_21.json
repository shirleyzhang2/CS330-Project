    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, you must generate the relation between them. The first word is called the 'concept' and the second word is called the 'relatum'. The relation must be one of the following: co-hyponym (coordinate), hypernym, meronym, attribute, event, or random. A coordinate relation indicates that the concept and relatum belong to the same semantic class. A hypernym relation indicates that the relatum is a category of which the concept is a specific instance. A meronym relation implies that relatum is a part/component/organ/member of the concept. An attribute relation is when the relatum is an adjective expressing an attribute of the concept. An event relation holds when the relatum is a verb referring to an action/activity/happening/event that is performed by or with the concept. If the relatum and concept are unrelated, the relation between them is 'random'. Your answers must be classified into coord, hyper, mero, attri, event, and random."
