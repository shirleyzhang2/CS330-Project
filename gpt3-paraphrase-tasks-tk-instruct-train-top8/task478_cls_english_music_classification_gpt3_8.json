I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

The surprises here are the lesser known songs that are beauts, for example TLC Tender Love and Care, Child of Clay (which reminds me of Elvis's In the Ghetto), and especially the lush and soulful Wonderful You.  The last mentioned song is a real treat, absolutely delicious.  Three songs missing that I would like to have were his versions of Just a closer walk with thee, The Wreck of John B. and The World I used to know.  Hope someday Jimmie's A&amp;M releases will be out on CD too.  In the meantime, I recommend this collectio",

The sound has more bottom to it (thanks to Bob Rock -- or no thanks?) but at the same time it isn't heavier, which is strange. At first I was very disappointed with the album (I have all their previous recordings), but it eventually grew on me.

All &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; versions are great, with a special attention to 'Tony Moran's Anthem Mix' and 'Ray Roc's Latin Soul Vocal Mix', turning this new single one of her bests.

Now that I've expanded my House collection my tastes have changed a little, but I still consider this to be a stellar Deep House album.  There are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it.  My favorites are \"Waiting\", \"Next To Me\", \"Don't Stand There\", \"Don't Change\", \"You Can't Stop\", \"Petalpushing\", \"The Remedy\", and \"Lionel's Jam\" (in that order).  I own just about everything Migs has put out and I consider this to be his best.  If I may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be Jay-J & Miguel Migs - In The House and Miguel Migs - Colorful You.  This latter one has some incredible R&B tracks.  My only criticism of Miguel Migs is that some of his tracks have too much Reggae and Latin/Jazz for my tastes.  Nevertheless, he is one of the best DJ/Producers I've ever heard.",

He seems always to be ploughing his own furrow, playing the music he wants to play and with partners of his choice. His impeccable taste and unique compostional style come from a deep  understanding of jazz and contemporary music. This recording is probably my  pick, but all come highly recommended. His sidemen know how to listen, the  empathy is astonishing, it really is a joy to hear. I look forward to  catching him on tour in England this Spring",

            "input": "Just WOW, No words to describe it. . Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through.     I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).    Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.     Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.    The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.    If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2",
