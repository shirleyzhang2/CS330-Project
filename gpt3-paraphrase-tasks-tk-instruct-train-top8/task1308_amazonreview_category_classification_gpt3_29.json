I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again.

We don't bake with them but they are supposed to be microwave safe, and we do use them that way. But, the one that exploded today was just sitting on the shelf, clean, with nothing in it. Two of us were standing there when it happened. We had glass everywhere. Fortunately, not sharp shards, just rounded edges, but some of the pieces landed almost six feet away from the shelf where the measuring cup was sitting. Scary. \n Category: other",

It took 3 x the recommended cooking time, which to get THAT info had to Google it. Our unit came with no recipe book or general cooking times. Plus, the 2 patties I cooked at the sizes stated above was all you could get on grill. No way in the world you will get 5 servings on the surface unless you are cooking for Smurfs! I had one of the first models back in the day and absolutely loved it. Although the removable grills are easy and convenient to clean, I believe the model that just has them attached would be a smarter choice. I'm gun shy now and probably not repurchase, because I don't believe the quality is as good as older models. \n Category: kitchen",

Their design allows for bees to get to the sugar solution, and they almost drove the hummingbirds away. I changed the sugar solution ratio and moved the hangers to a shaded area to try to discourage the bees but nothing worked. If this sounds familiar, don't lose hope. Just purchase a feeder where the openings are facing upward so no sugar solution can drip out, and the bees will get discouraged and leave. With my new feeder, I can watch the hummingbirds feeding without the bees to harass them. \n Category: pc",
