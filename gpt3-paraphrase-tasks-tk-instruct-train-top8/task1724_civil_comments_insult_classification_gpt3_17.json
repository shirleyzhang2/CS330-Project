People are attacking each other right and left because they are so frustrated with what the upper administrative government is doing and not doing.....  State workers are actually being threatened and treated like dirt for doing their jobs ...................People it's not the state workers doing it. \nPeople who've never had to pay an income tax can't stand the idea of having to pay and they are the worst ones to scream,  and they ARE screaming......   I hear a certain talk radio show in the morning and people call in there and actually BELIEVE that they shouldn't EVER have to contribute by paying state taxes  but they want everything the state has to give them.

What vehicle type do people like you drive?\nI know that I for one, have issues with young cowboys driving lifted trucks with giant tires extending well beyond the wheel well, flying Confederate flags while spitting chewing tobacco, listening to country drinking songs and rolling coal.
