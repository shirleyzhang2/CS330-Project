Starring a comment, as I've seen it applied on this site, does, in fact, represent agreement with that comment.  BTW: I see you failed to \"star\" my comment. Does that mean you feel my imput on the issue of smoking in County Parks is not valuable?  Up to this point in time Mr. Bozievich hasn't \"starred\" my comment.  Does that mean he feels Outsider's imput is valuable, but mine isn't?  Gosh, now my feelings are hurt.....",

The Oregon State Police officer had every right to shoot Finicum, in order to protect the officer that Finicum was facing, and posing a threat to.",

We have been told by the NTSB that they will be investigating those areas. Those of us making comments only know the immediate outcome. As well as determining probable cause, if possible, the NTSB may also make safety recommendations. I read a briefing of one accident report which states that the NTSB had issued 34 safety recommendations and these were not limited to the actions of the pilots; one recommendation was to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I have read of ones related to a particular part of an aircraft which applies to the manufacturer of that part, and so on... I will provide bird strike data answers a question contained in another comment.  \n\nI also appreciate  that you are obviously proactive in the area of aviation safety, having listed the Medallion Foundation.",
