            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time, and have used it as a reference ever since.  What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance.  So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed.  No other work like it had been available.    And what a revelation about many of them.  Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it.    Really needed and really wonderful work",

His basic failure is an utter lack of examining the gendered nature of warfare.  In short: Men make war.  Yes, there plenty of instances where women engage in war, but those are far and away the exception and not the rule.  Both the leaders who build wars and the soldiers who fight them are almost exclusively male.  This is a consistent fact across all cultures around the globe and throughout history.  Broadly speaking, women simply do not make war.  This single and glaring oversight immediately destroy's Hillman's hypothesis that war is somehow a universal human archetype",

Kenny Schilling, a football player in an \"O.J.\" type standoff with the cops is accused of murdering another player.  He wants Andy Carpenter to defend him.  Kenny has no recollection of what happened while the murder took place, just like one of Andy's prior clients (remember \"Open and Shut\").  Andy takes on the case and seems to change his theory as to what transpired almost every 50 pages of the book.  Hidden in the background of the story is his relationship with Laurie, who has an irresistible offer that would involve breaking up with Andy.  You need to wait till almost the end of the book to find out the outcome (unless you already had a sneak peak into the author's next book).    Though the book is better than a lot of courtroom thrillers out there it is slow the first 150-200 pages (the book is only about 300 pages) and Andy seems to not be as sharp witted and interesting as he was in the author's prior works.  Also, the author tries to fake out the reader twice with resolutions but both times there are still a lot of pages to go and so unresolved fine details (reminiscent of the movie \"Taking Lives\") that the reader is far from fooled.    This book should be read but you should start with the author's first book (\"Open and Shut\") before getting to it.",

This is one of those books which needs a little introduction: in Australia, the Kelly Gang is famous the way that Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde are in the US.

It shows how incredibly talented Peter Carey is, and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter",

It is a shame how this target is not reached. Since from the very begin, the introduction, you will face an answer: what is its usefulness? You'll hope that, going on reading, everything will be clearer, and, from a certain point of view, this is what you get: what you've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students. However the text neither is \"practical\" nor gives you the \"in-depth-analysis\" you were hoping since its title begins with \"Advanced\". Schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed. Mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs. Apart from this it is a good effort. In my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition, if there will be a next edition",
