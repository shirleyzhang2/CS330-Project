        "In this task, you are given a tuple consisting of Head and Tail events, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail or not. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
