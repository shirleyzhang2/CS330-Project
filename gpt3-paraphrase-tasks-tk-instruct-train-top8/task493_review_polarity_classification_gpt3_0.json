Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad",

I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe.

Laces are long enough to wrap around ankles, and back of shoe forms a fair notch to retain the laces and keep them from sliding up and off the shoes - would have been better had there been a rear loop. Shoes are better without the insoles because they put a spongy foam wedge under the heels. I replaced them with thin flat insoles from a pair of water shoes. One could cut the foam wedge and use the included insoles. There is no raised heel other than that foam wedge. They run true to size or slightly tight.",
