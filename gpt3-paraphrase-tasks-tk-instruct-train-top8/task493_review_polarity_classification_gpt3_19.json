I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!",

When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of \"Predators\". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like \"Predators\". If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.Would I watch again? - No way! I will not be getting this for my store.*Also try - Predators",

I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!",
