        "Given an object and a part, decide if the object has that part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts. Answer 1 if it does, and 0 if it does not. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
