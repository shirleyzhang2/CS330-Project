This puts them at an extreme disadvantage in the food chain.  As mentioned before, cats don't just hunt to survive, they also hunt for sport.  I've had to deal with feral cats on a couple of occasions.  Like any wild animal, they are viscous, territorial and dangerous.  Feral cats aren't the same as your average house cat.  Yes, they are the same species but they're a completely different animal.  I would prefer not to have to kill them, but like Old Yeller, some times what must be done, must be done.\n\nI challenge anyone to propose a reasonable alternative to eradication.  I know of none since these cats have no real natural habitat.  TNR is not a reasonable solution for any invasive species.  It devastates an entire ecosystem just to protect a handful of cats.  It should remain illegal.",

Their greatest worry for \"killing\" anyone, would be that they may get on Santa's \"bad\" list.  In their childish world view, they have not yet grasped what death really is.  How often are children told that \"Grandma is in heaven with Jesus, watching over us.\"  In my day, we played \"Cowboys and Indians\" all the time, and we \"killed\"each other all day long.

Their interest has been in how to get degrees to as many students as possible in as short a time as possible for as little expense as possible. Their euphemism for degrading education is \"removing obstacles to graduation.\" I wouldn't count on them for holding anyone accountable for anything but spending less.\n\nThe UO, like many universities, has to cater to a customer base that includes out of state and international students in order for it to stay in business. How far this catering goes depends on \"enrollment management\" needs. EM is quite a complicated part of the forecasting business for hitting targets. These customers require marketing strategies and retention efforts against competition from other U's.\n\nGiven the pressures and limits, faculty at the UO generally do a courageous and effective job of preserving educational quality.",
