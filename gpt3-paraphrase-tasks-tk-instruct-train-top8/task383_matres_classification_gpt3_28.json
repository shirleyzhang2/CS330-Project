        "You will receive a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to output \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time, and \"No\" otherwise. A verb can be anchored in time if it happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future."

NATO decided at last year's Madrid summit to (invite) the three eastern European countries to start accession talks.  \n Verb: invite",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."

O'Donnell declined to discuss what federal charges were being pursued, but she said that in a case like this, potential charges would be abortion-related violence, the use of a firearm in an act of violence, crossing state lines to commit a crime, and, if the suspect's act was (tied) to an organization, violation of the so-called RICO statutes, which prohibit an organized criminal enterprise.  \n Verb: tied",
            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
