I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

This is big - too big and too \"in your face\" with any normal depth desk. horrible, horrible IPS glow. IN all fairness it is hard to get a pic of IPS glow but this is the best I can get. The center part should be black so the corners will be slightly dimmer than the mustard color in the pic - but size and position of it is accurate. This one is going back- I hope the replacement is better but I am not confident in it. For $1,200 this should be greatly reduced and WTH is up with the flip-phone sounding speakers it has? Gaming is ok on it, but it is nice for desktop space for multiple applications. so it gets 2 stars.",

The support it gave to my back felt nice, but I only wore it for about an hour because the product is extremely short!! I\u2019m only 5\u20194 and the product did not cover my torso that much, very disappointing. In addition I ordered above what size I should\u2019ve for some room since I really want back support more than weight loss. I ordered an XL, but my waist measurement was in the L bracket, yet it was very short. I have pretty a curvy body already, this product did make me look more curvy but because of the length it was super unflattering",
