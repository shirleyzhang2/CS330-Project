Standard tunes like \"Unforgetable\" and \"Europe\" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on \"Sheila\" and \"Kicker\", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote",
