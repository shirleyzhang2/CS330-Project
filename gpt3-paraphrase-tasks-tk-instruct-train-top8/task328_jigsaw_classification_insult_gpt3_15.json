I know what causes earthquakes, and judging by this conversation probably have a better grasp of it than you. All earthquakes are caused by some sort of unique geology. In the case of Oklahoma the cause is injecting large amounts of waste water into the Arbuckle formation (much larger amounts than what we inject here in Colorado). The Arbuckle has unique characteristics that make it different than the formations we inject water into in Colorado, one being it directly overlies crystalline basement rock. The interface between the Arbuckle and the basement rock is the perfect spot for a fault to slip when lubricated/pressured up. Yeah, he's a moron, and Trump is a moron, quit trying to politically troll me because IDGAF.",

Old-school theory has it that a sharp demarcation is good because it minimizes stray light, delivering lumens right where the design engineer wants them and nowhere else.  So I can see why they'd strive for that.\n\nBut the engineer isn't an MD and hasn't a clue about the physiologic (and even psychologic) effects of these abrupt transitions. \n\nAnd alignment?  Nowadays it's nothing more than the red-haired stepchild to vehicle design fashions.  Function follows form, at a considerable distance.",
