            "input": "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned .\nit 's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth .\nthe lion king had just cracked $ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast .\nsince then , though , disney 's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year 's hercules successively proving less and less potent .\nwith the once seemingly - impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox 's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid .\nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top - notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but\nthe wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music .\nthe film 's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince .\nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions .\nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she 's resolutely smitten , and she 's such a pure and endearing character that one ca n't help but invest their heart with her .\nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture .\none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .\nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams ' much - heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities .\nwhile it 's understandable that animated features lacking the name - recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto 's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia 's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it 's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy .\ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ?\nis the film 's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ?\n( i 'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . )\nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast .\nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film 's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms .\nbenson provides a most engaging anchor for the film .\n( she 's the only reason i 'd even consider catching flubber . )\nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific\nin the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab .\nhe easily milks his lovable character 's comic moments for all they 're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid 's big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend .\npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea - witch ursula ,\nwhile kenneth mars ' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel 's father , king triton .\nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast .\nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr .\nashman 's untimely death .\nnot only are mr .\nmenken 's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr .\nashman 's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film 's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character 's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film .\nmr .\nmenken 's score for the film is equally top - notch ;\nthe sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse - drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr .\nmenken 's fine score .\nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso - styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr .\nwright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re - release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but\nmy favourite is ms .\nbenson 's heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr .\nashman ) which , accompanied by the film 's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes\n.\nduring the song 's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history .\nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney 's limited 17-day re - release of the little mermaid .\nthere 's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film 's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney 's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox 's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia .\nin every respect , the re - release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film 's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $ 100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $ 10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively - marketed anastasia in head - to - head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film 's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney 's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .\nbut although disney 's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self - serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public .\nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it 's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen\n.\nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney 's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .",

pies come out .\n\"\nwhat sort of pies ?\nchicken pies , of course .\nco - director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar - winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave .\n\"\nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .\npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park 's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .\n\"\nthe wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .\nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .\nnow teaming with co - director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run .\n\"\nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball - bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg - inspired action sequences providing the excitement .\nthing is , the film does n't feel like it 's been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done\n.\npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners - of - war movie starring chickens ?\npark and lord milk the incongruity for all\nit 's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .\nbut they 're * chickens * ,\nso\nit 's funny to us .\nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park 's films ) succeed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they 're cribbing .\nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 .\n\"\nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom .\n\"\nthere 's even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light - hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson 's nationality and film history .\nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it .\nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i 've seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .\nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .\nwhy ?\nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they 're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch ' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .\nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .\nconversely , \" chicken run \" does n't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .\nif you 've never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun .\neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .\npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it 's understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .\nenjoyment of this movie does n't require knowledge of film history , but if you 've got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer .\nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it 's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .\nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it .\nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung - ho veneer .\nthe characters ' inevitable romance does n't feel contrived , but sweet .\npoor mr .\ntweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly is n't any help .\njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one - liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply - trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing - dancing sequence .\nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that 's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .\none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run ,\n\" it comes as a delightful surprise .\nthe film manages to cross all barriers\n; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .\nthe animation is first - rate . remember that this was all done the old - fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable\n\" chicken run \" really is .\nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios ' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .\nas in such top - notch family fare as \" a bug 's life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame .\ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they 'll catch all the details .\nanyway , the movie 's just\na boatload of fun\n. funnest damn movie\ni 've seen all year .",
