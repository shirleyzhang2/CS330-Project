        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Your task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output No. no-need is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, which then implies that the item is up for grabs."
