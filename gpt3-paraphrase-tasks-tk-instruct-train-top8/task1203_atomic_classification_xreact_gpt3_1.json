    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, where Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants, and the names of specific people have been replaced by generic words, your task is to determine whether, as a result of the Head, the subject of the event (PersonX) may feel what is mentioned in the Tail. The feeling is an emotional reaction on the part of X or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, X might feel good about [one]self. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
