    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). If the utterance contains the no-need strategy, output 'Yes', otherwise output 'No'. no-need is a cooperative negotiation strategy which is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, suggesting that the item is up for grabs. This strategy can directly benefit the opponent."
