        "You will receive a paragraph, event and entity. The event is part of the paragraph and it changes the state of the entity. The entity's state will fall into one of three categories: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location, 3) known location. \"not exist\" means the entity doesn't exist in that state anymore. \"unknown location\" means the entity exists in that state but location is unknown. \"known location\" means the entity exists and location is known."
