I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

Thankfully I don't use my laptop for long periods of time, that being said, I can't get more than 2 hours out of a charge. It is longer than the battery it replaced which required being plugged in constantly to function. It was much cheaper than an original, but the original would have given me 6 hours, assuming it is the same as the one it came with many moons ago. It was a bit snug to install, but it fit. It also argued with charging at first, needing babysat while charging to ensure it was being accepted or something. Very often it would say the battery is not compatible, but would do that off and on while charging. I do not remember if I had to do anything unusual to make it charge all the way, but I eventually made it work. So...FYI. \n Rating: 2",
