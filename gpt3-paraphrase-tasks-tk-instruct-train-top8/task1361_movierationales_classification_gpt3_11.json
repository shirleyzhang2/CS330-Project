or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in \" miller 's crossing \" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in \" fargo .\n\" in all cases , and in \" o brother , \" too , the characters populating their films are three - dimensional people .\nulysses everett is a handsome , hair - obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department .\nbut , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $ 1 . 2 million .\ntheir odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer 's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money .\nthere is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens .\nthe story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys ' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow .\nsome of the interludes are an epiphany , though .\nthe trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar - playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) .\nthey become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , \" i am a man of constant sorrow .\n\"\nit is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year\n.\ncontrasting this and other wonderful moments\n( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of \" o brother .\n\" in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched .\nthe scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of \" the wizard of oz .\n\"\nthey do n't say \" lions and tigers and bears , oh my !\n\" and there 's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we 're seeing here .\nthe highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels .\ngeorge clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today .\nhe has the charm of a 30 's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity .\nulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets .\nhis vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero - wanderer .\nwhile clooney is the name draw for \" o brother , \" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar .\nthe heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism .\ndelmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine .\nthe taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst .\nall together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones .\nthe colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys ' odyssey .\ncharles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re - election .\njohn goodman is wicked as the one - eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague .\nmichael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary\n, george \" babyface \" nelson .\nstephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways .\nholly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses ' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) .\ntechs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture ,\nfirst class .\ncinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south .\nthe photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively .\nonce again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor .\nthe high points outweigh the low through most of \" o brother , where art thou ?\n\" with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music .\ni give it a b .",
