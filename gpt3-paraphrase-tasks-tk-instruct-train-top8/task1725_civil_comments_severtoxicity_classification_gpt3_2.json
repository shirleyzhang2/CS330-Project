I have said before if you start taking away, in this case AR15's, then what is the gun of choice for the political hacks to go after next. Once they know they can violate a right what is to say they will not violate a right that is near and dear to you. Like your freedom to speak, your freedom to travel,etc.  The framers and founders went through tyranny. That is why they put safe guards into place in an attempt to not have it happen again. As for registration. Adolf Hilter did that in the name of safety and then later confiscated. He who trust the government for all things in life is in the company of fools.",

Certainly the larger areas like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Soldotna already have sufficient state offices to handle a couple legislators taking up residence.\n\nThe one point I disagree with you on though is expanding the legislature. We've tried measures, including cutting the session from 121 to 90 days to put them back in communities, instead they dither and run up special sessions. Why add more opinions and conflict in, while increasing costs to the public?",

It was specifically authorized by President Obama according to his press secretary.\n\nWhat other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?  \n\nAnd the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.  \n\nNo.  Tom, the wars are not over, just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.\n\nYou are doing a Bill Clinton - trying to define a word so it meets your needs, not the reality recognized by non-believers.  \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman!\"  \n\nThese are not 'wars'!
