, which sounds like as made - up a name as i 've ever heard .\nif it is , i ca n't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .\na plotless , pointless rock n ' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny .\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are .\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana - laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy .\n\" there is no set - up , just a succession of punchlines that do n't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set - up .\nit 's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ?\nfunny !\n\" look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink .\nsee ?\nfunny !\nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .\ntwice .\nsee ?\nfunny !\nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .\nsee ?\nfunny !\na word of advice to mr .\ndupr ?\n:\nno , these things are n't funny all by themselves .\nthey must be preceded by a clever set - up so\nthe audience hasn ' t predicted them five minutes in advance .\nthat 's it\n, i 've said enough about this movie .\nit 's a waste of time and money .\ni liked the music , but do n't bother buying the soundtrack .\ni hear it ' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie .\nyou want to see this concept executed well ?\ngo rent roger corman 's 1979 classic \" rock n ' roll high school .\n\"\nit features another late - seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .\nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .",
