    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The possible types of relations are 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. 'HYPER' applies when the first word (X) is a specific instance of the second word (Y). 'COORD' applies when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. If neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
