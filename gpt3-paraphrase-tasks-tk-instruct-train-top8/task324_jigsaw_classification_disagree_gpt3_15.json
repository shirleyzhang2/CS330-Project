        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Disagree means that the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. Agree means that the comment is not likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

Obamacare was a shoddy compromise that provided a partial sop to the insurance companies and an unsustainable model for poorer Americans.\n\nWhile it is well-nigh impossible to objectively rank health care -- even the World Health Organization gave it up as futile -- it is easy to see that the US spends more per capita than any nation in the world, and arguably provides worse service than almost any in the West.\n\nThis is largely due to a powerful medical lobby and routine gouging of both citizens and insurance companies.  Tylenol administered in hospital is as high as $15 per pill, and the cost of one stitch can exceed $500.\n\nIf the US wants to fix its health insurance problem, they should start by legislating cost caps for routine procedures.  Profiteering through human suffering is disgusting.",

Brown is not even in power and has been caught in at least two lies, with one being the repeal of the sexual education reforms. He is trying to be everything to everyone (e.g., progressive and socially conservative), which does not make a good leader. Sadly, I trust Wynne more than I trust him. As for Horwath, she is incompetent, which was abundantly clear during the last election. If she is the best that the NDP can do, then the party will never form a government.",

We hate the niqab and burqa too but realise that they will not disappear with a ban. The only thing Europe has succeeded in doing with their bans is to further ghettoise and isolate the Muslim communities, which makes it easier for radicalisation. Things change by having subsequent generations integrate more into mainstream and secular society, something that Canada does fairly well. It's slow (a matter of generations) but effective, particularly since we do not have nowhere near the same level of influx Europe has.",
