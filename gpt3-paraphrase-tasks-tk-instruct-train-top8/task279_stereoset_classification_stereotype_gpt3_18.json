        "In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or be unrelated. Your task is to classify the passage into one of three classes: stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. If the passage does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype, then it is classified as unrelated."
