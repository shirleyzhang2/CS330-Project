            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "Very little action, and other problems . You have to read about 180 pages of this book before any action starts. I was frankly bored by the entire book. Once the action starts, it's fairly contrived. Reacher is one of those very lucky or very unlucky \"heros.\" And if you're one of those readers who like to try to figure out who is doing the dirty deeds, you can't. There are absolutely no clues you can use to determine the perpetrators.    And who says the Secret Service doesn't act proactively? While this is one of the book's major premises, the history of the Service is filled with proactive activities to protect those who come under their care.    I remember once when the President came to my hometown and spoke on the Statehouse steps. Office workers in nearby buildings used telescopes to get a better view. All of them were seen by Secret Service agents and men with guns visited them in one big hurry. Radios were used in abundance. And this was over thirty years ago. Do you think the Service has become more capable or less capable since then? If a single radio was used in this story, the perpetrators would have been caught about halfway through the book.    When President Bush (the first one) wanted to walk across the Mackinac Bridge for the annual walk, they took over the entire hotel where he would be staying, and not because they needed the space. A list of others who would be in attendance during the walk and at the dinner the previous evening had to be vetted starting 6 weeks prior to his visit, including local police. They even kept the pitcher of ice tea that he would be drinking from in a locked box watched over by an agent (same with condiments). After spending a bazillion dollars up to and after the President's meal, the Prez graciously paid for his own meal, and left a nice tip. Big of him. So agents don't just show up a couple of hours or in one case in the book, a few minutes before the big event, and throw a cordon around him.     I was also left with some unexplained questions at the end.    So, it's dull, inaccurate, and an insult to those brave souls who protect our nation's leaders",

This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it.  Well, I didn't love it.  While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature.  There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers.  I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all.  It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author.",
