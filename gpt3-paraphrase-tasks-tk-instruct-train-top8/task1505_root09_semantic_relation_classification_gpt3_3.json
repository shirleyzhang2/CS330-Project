    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a pair of words. Your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The possible types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. The first word will be denoted by X and the second word will be denoted by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If neither COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM."
