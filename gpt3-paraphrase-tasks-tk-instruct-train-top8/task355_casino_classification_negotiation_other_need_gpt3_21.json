    "Reasoning": [],
    "Definition": [
        "The input for this task is taken from a negotiation between two participants who take on the role of campsite neighbors. They negotiate for Food, Water, and Firewood packages based on their individual preferences and requirements. If, given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (whenever available), the utterance contains the other-need strategy, output Yes. Otherwise, output No. The other-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used when the participants discuss a need for someone else rather than themselves. An example of this would be describing the need for firewood to keep the kids warm."

'Hmm, that's not favorable for me going by the volume of items left in my arsenal. Water is more of a higher priority than food. So, I would exchange 1 pack of food for an additional water' 'So that way you would get two waters and two foods? Those are my priorities as well but i would be ok with it since that way i would get five items and you would get only four.'\nUtterance: 'Those are your priorities?? Then that's not fair for you. Then I take 2 water, 1 firewood and 1 food. This is the lowest I can offer'",
