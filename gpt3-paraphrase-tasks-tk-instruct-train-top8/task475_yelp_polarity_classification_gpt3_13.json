            "input": "This is a heaven sent Filipino Asian mart serving the fast growing Filipino community in northern North Vegas. Sorry Dracula..they have consummable blood here, but not the human kind...but you can choose between pork or beef blood.  Why?  A true Filipino has at least once eaten dinuguan -- the coconut milk-blood-vinegar-hog moss and meat stew.  Perhaps the most favorite FIlipino dish of all is pancit, the noodle dish that is prepared in many different ways using rice noodles (wide or thin) as well as bean thread for the more liquid bihon pancit.  They have most of the ingredients for the festive pancit palabok.  Another Filipino favorite is lumpia, the deep fried eggroll which you can mix and fill the thin rice pancake or already filled.  In my years of trying over 100 versions of lumpia, the best ones are homemade, not frozen already made.\\n\\nThis is a family owned and operated store located at Centennial and SImmons, about a block away from Smith's to the north, a mile from Aliante Casino, and sandwhiched between a car rental company and Scher Firestone Tire. My relatives have been shopping here since they opened at Ann and SImmons about a mile away. This newer location is bigger and cleaner. If you don't know exactly what you need, the owners are a great help  when the store isn't real busy. \\n\\nOther staples include canned and frozen veggies, rice, and snacks. And they sometimes carry seasonal produce like platanos, mangoes, calamansi, but not always.They also sell some prepared dessets made by a local Filipino bakery, like Macha, a soft cream coconut and corn based dessert as well as purple ube, white, and orange sapin-sapin and puto cuchinta (brown sugar gelatinous mini cupcake), and palitaw. This is a boiled patty of sweet rice coated with fresh grated coconut, and you sprinkle white sugar on top.  However, I don't need any of that right now.  As I'm typing this, my mom is making suman, a sweet rice in coconut milk in brown sugar dessert baked and topped with a brown sugar, butter, and coconut milk topping.  All the ingredients are from Little Divisoria, which means little all in one shopping mart back on the islands.",

Unfortunately we have now removed this Italian themed bastard step child of the Fox Restaurant Concepts family. The place just plainly sucks. Service is lackluster and so is the food. Overpriced,bland and void of any excitement. Highlight of the visit was when the upon paying for my food with a credit card the cashier told me to \\\"\"Like, fill out this receipt\\\"\", when I asked for clarification he stated \\\"\"You need to write in the total, tip and sign, most people tip\\\"\". EXCUSE ME! Why would i tip you? I don't tip the cashier at a gas station, and you pal are not even as cheery as the gas station employees I come in contact with. If my food or service was above and beyond in a quick service setting I would certainly tip (being in the service industry for years I know you work for tip). The definition of bad training and customer service. \\n\\nThen I realized what truly bothers me about this place....the manager is completely lacking any managerial skills or presence in the restaurant. She was dressed sloppily and we thought she was a customer until she asked us how our salads where. My boyfriend have his usual \\\"\"Adequate\\\"\" and responded with \\\"\"Just OK\\\"\". She then smiled and scurried away from our table. I see how it is Sauce, you are just trying to be adequate, well that being the goal you are barely meeting it.",

Not to mention very unprofessional.\\n\\nAs our days in Vegas slowly came to an end, my girl friend recommended that we get massages at this location because it's her favorite place. I was massaged by an old man who hardly used ANY oil. It literally felt like a drop for each body part, and went completely rough on my head - which wasn't hurting to begin with, but was pounding by the time he was done. I didn't like his technique AT ALL. Afterwards I asked my girl friend how her massage was, and even she said hers sucked!\\n\\nI regret coming here, and regret even tipping him $5 for his poor skills.",

Also the restaurant was only about 1/4 full on a Friday night, never a good sign.  Go to Lulu's off central instead.",
