    "Definition": [
        "Given two sentences, you must evaluate the similarity between them and classify them into one of the following classes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Class 0 means the two sentences are completely dissimilar. Class 1 means the two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the same topic. Class 2 means the two sentences are not equivalent, but share some details. Class 3 means the two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs or is missing. Class 4 means the two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ. Class 5 means the two sentences are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing."
