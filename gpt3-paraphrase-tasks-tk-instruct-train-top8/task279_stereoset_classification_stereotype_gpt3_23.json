        "Given a short passage, your task is to classify it as either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. If the passage does not convey a stereotype or anti-stereotype, it is classified as unrelated."
