) .\nthey fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off .\nhe then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland .\nboth ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment .\nconnor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield .\nkatana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander .\nif you have never seen it . being a fan of highlander and mr .\nconnery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii :\nthe quickening .\ni wish it had been quicker .\ni feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said .\nthe film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so\n( the time mr .\nconnery is on the screen for ) is worth watching .\nthe plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance .\nmaybe they could pull it off .\ninstead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film .\nit 's as if they are different people with the same names .\nwitness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of \" who wants to live forever , when love must die \" gone to ?\nthe love sub - plot\n* must * have had footage cut out .\nthe highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before .\nputting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying .\ni still want to know why connor 's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal !\nwe are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill .\nwhy not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ?\ni know the head needs to come off\nbut you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first .\nto be fair one assassin tried this\nbut he must be the world 's worst shot .\nmeanwhile connor develops luke - skywalker - like powers of laser beam deflection .\nas for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist .\ntwo assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems .\nno more assassins are sent .\nkatana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor .\nhas he no more assassins ?\nhas he no better ?\nwhy was the rebellion crushed so easily then ?\nmichael ironside is totally unconvincing\n( bring back the kurgan ) .\nhe seems like a cartoon character and really is n't that evil , just stupid and violent .\nwe see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents .\nyet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins would n't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo .\nso much for plot and characters .\nthe music is atrocious .\nit is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . bring back queen .\nthere was an audible sigh ( of relief ? )\nwhen connor played a queen track in a juke box .\ni believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release .\nthe acting is at best flat , except for mr .\nconnery .\nlambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it\njust made me wish there had only been one -- highlander .\nmichael ironside is unconvincing\n; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable .\nso why 2/10 ?\nvisually the film is interesting at all times .\nit has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning .\nadd to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ?\nhis lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile\nhad it not been so obvious that he can not take the whole thing seriously at all\nbut hey\n--\n*\ni 'd * have done it for 12 million .\noh , and i agree with a previous reviewer\n, she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film .\nincidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .",

cut several times .\nthis is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .\nthere 's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher .\nother than that ,\nthe effects are second - rate .\nthe weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .\nthurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it does n't work .\nshe looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits\nbut there 's no spark .\nfiennes fares even less well\n.\nmacnee 's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .\nfiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown -
