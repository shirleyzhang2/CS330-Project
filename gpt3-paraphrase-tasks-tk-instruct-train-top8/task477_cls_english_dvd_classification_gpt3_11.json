As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...    Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the   see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.",

            "input": "Hollywood Apocalypse... Sorta . It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.    As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that \"Day of the Locust\" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.    \"Locust\" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.    But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.    It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in \"An Englishman Abroad\". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.    It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...    Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, \"Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!\" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot.     To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a \"symbolic\" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours.     Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after \"Locust\" appeared. Then they went and made this movie. Remember that next time you start thinking that life is unfair.",

The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force.",

            "input": "2 Whole Stars...I Must Be In A Generous Mood . Like the title says, I'm being mad generous by giving this movie two stars...it really deserves none. Subspecies is an excellent, 4-part series written and directed by Full Moon Studio's Ted Nicholau (Actually, the first three Subspecies are allright, but the fourth movie sucks in my opinion). However, Vampire Journals is nothing more than a feeble attempt to portray a different side of the Subspecies archetype.     The characters, scenes, and acting in Subspecies Part 1-3 were superb. Yet this movie has an insipid plot and the actors are novice at best. The vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors, and I was bored for the last 1/3 of the film.     Essentially, the plot...if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named Zachary, who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is. So Zachary (Whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire Zachary anyway?) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by Ashe, a fledgling of the main antagonist (Radu)of all the Subspecies films.    In addition to this, Zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named Sophia, who has been kidnapped by Ashe. Because she is a gifted musician...or something, Sophia is being forced by Ashe, a  fervid music lover, into becoming a vampire as well. Really there's not much else to go into, except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film. So unless you're a die-hard Subspecies fan, or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends, try watching Subspecies 1-3 because they're the best you're gonna get from director Ted Nicholau",

We bought \"the series.\"  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute \"movies\" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as \"The Complete Season!",

It is important that the world understands how and why this happened, and i commend all people who make an effort to recast and teach the world the terror that so many were subjected to.  Yes, we all know Robin Williams to be the slapstick comedian which has brought tears of laughter to our eyes instead of ones of compassion. But like  Roberto Benigni in Life is Beautiful, Williams brings to life a character who tries to lift the spirits of friends and strangers who are looking for one thing, hope.  Whether Williams' character was real or imaginary, the human spirit can never be completely wiped by tyranny and oppression. 10 million people, including 6 million Jews were systematically killed before the Nazi's were finally stopped. Some died as fighters, some gave their lives for others, and some gave just simple acts of kindness, good will, and love. Each one of them were heroes of their own kind.   William's character told lies about Russian troop advancement to give the Jews of his Ghetto the will to survive and resist. Like real life heroes such as Rauol Wallenberg, Oskar Schindler, Mordecai Anielewicz, Hannah Senesh, and thousands of others who risked their lives for others, this is a story of a good man.   Maybe this movie was not an exact interpretation of its predecessors, books or movies, and yes it did have some hollywood-like moments. But oeverall, a tribute to the men, women, and children who shall always be remembered and never forgotten",

One, Peter Sellers as  Chief Inspector Closeau seem to take the spirit of the Panther films to the grave with him    Two, This was the last Film of David Niven. The rumor of Rich Little dubbing his voice rings true, if you watch Niven's lips and what is coming out of them.Niven who was very ill with MS just did a lot of sitting and limited movement.     Three, Ted Wass tries to bumble and stumble like Sellers's trademark character-however He is NO CLOSEAU. The more he pratfalls, the most we miss and wish Sellers were still alive    Four, the supporting cast (Robert Loggia, Herbert Lom, Leslie Ash, Robert Wagner, Joanna Lumley, Capucine, David Niven, Harvey Korman) are given almost nothing to do in this film, other than to be a foil to Wass's pratfalls or straight men to Wass's so called craziness. Burt Kwouk  as Cato is given more to do in his small scene with Wass and you wonder why he isnt in more of the film. And Roger Moore's cameo as a remade Closeau is poor preformance, playing on Seller's trademark accent and his James Bond Character    Five, Blake Edwards's script seem a weak closure to the Genre. And to make matters worse, he even did another Pink Panther (Son of the Pink Panther)after this,  which was WORSE than this film     AND THOSE ARE THE GOOD POINTS    I give it two stars for the stellar supporting cast alone, that makes this film worth it    Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORL",
