    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a tweet that contains irony. Classify the type of irony by outputting \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\". \"Polarity\" irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Output \"other\" for any other kind of irony."
