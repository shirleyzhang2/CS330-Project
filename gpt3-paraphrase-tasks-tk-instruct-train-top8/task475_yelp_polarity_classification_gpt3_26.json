Though it can get a bit loud and crowded, that's what happens when a place is popular. Both the inside and outside decor are both modern, yet extremely comfortable. The menu is simple but tastefully done. I love the bruschettas, the paninis, the salads, the desserts.... This is one of my favorite places for brunch, and I have even used them to cater one of my parties with great success. As a matter of fact, now that I am writing this, I think I will go back tomorrow. It already has been too long.",

Yes, the chips are free and warm, but they are very thin and if you are dipping, most will break in half. Fonda uses that dumb salsa in a jar style which still makes no sense (Give us a bowl of salsa). My main course was a watery, messy disaster and the owner who I will call \\\"\"mama\\\"\" could barely defend her chile relleno after I called her out on the nasty food. The coating on the tiny pepper fell off and somehow it looked like my plate got flooded with pepper juice or an unknown liquid, possibly from the watery beans (see pics). Mama did shoot back a comment, but never full stood at our table and chatted after she got a negative response from me over the standard \\\"\"How is everything\\\"\" question. Keep serving up that slop mama and believing your Mexican food is good, but the smart diners will go elsewhere for a better experience. If I wanted soup, I would have ordered it mama!",

The salsa tasted like someone put a jar of oregano in it. It was awful! I ordered a Carnitas burrito. I had to ask them to add beans and rice to a 10 dollar burrito. I was like what the hell?? Asked them to put green sauce on it as well. It was sooo bland and boring. Green sauce had no spice or flavor. Would not recommend this place. Crappy and overpriced. My friends dish was also very bland. Should of went to Del Taco. The good side was that the Staff was friendly..",
