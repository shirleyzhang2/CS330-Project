    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You are given a candidate sentence for the second sentence, and you need to determine if it connects the first sentence to the rest of the story. If the candidate sentence connects the first sentence to the rest of the story, output \"Yes\". If the candidate sentence does not connect the first sentence to the rest of the story, output \"No\". A sentence is considered incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
