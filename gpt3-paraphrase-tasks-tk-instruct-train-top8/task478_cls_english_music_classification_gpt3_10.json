I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated.  These people are entitled to their opinion.  That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album.  Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music.  His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now).  Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.      This is the Slayer album I listen to the least.  There are song good songs:  Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky.  Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring.",

It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $..",

Based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of Joe's playing I picked up the CD/DVD combo(Amazon) and was, I hate to admit it, dissappointed. Granted, he can play and has good chops, but for me, something was missing. Maybe that intangible. The fire that comes through  the amps. Not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view, but for me it was lacking. I need to watch it again to see if I feel the same way. Like the a previous two star reviewer, I would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone's basement and would walked away satisfied. But when you start playing with the big boys, this guy comes up short",

At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.    This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).    Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique",
