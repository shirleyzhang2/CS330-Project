    "Definition": [
        "For a given pair of words, you will need to deduce the type of relationship between them. There are three possible types of relations: 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. The first word in the pair will be denoted as X and the second word will be denoted as Y. A COORD relationship exists when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship exists when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable, then the relationship is RANDOM."
