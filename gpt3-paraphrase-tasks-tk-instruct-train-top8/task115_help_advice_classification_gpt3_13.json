        "You will read a sentence and determine if it is a general piece of advice. If it is, indicate \"yes\". Otherwise, indicate \"no\". Advice is offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in direct and indirect forms. Direct advice is using words (e.g., suggest, advice, recommend), verbs (e.g., can, could, should, may), or questions (e.g., why don't you's, how about, have you thought about) to give advice. Indirect advice is when someone hints at what they did in a similar situation or implies that an action should or should not be taken."
