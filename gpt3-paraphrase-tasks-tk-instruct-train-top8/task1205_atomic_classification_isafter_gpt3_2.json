    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. Head and Tail are events that may involve participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether the Head happens after the Tail or not. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
