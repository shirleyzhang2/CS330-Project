    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, your task is to determine whether The Tail is the reason for the Head or not. The reason provides a post-fact explanation of the cause of an event. For example, if the Head is \"PersonX has to walk\", and the Tail is \"a car has broken down\", then the answer would be \"Yes\". If the Head is \"PersonX has to walk\", and the Tail is \"it is raining\", then the answer would be \"No\". Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
