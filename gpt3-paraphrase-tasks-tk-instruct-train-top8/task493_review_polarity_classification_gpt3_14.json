I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade.",

But it has become one of my favorite movies, especially war movies that try to tell some real truth about the time frames they cover. The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would. I believe the movie is excellent. The DVD arrived two days earlier than expected, so the seller gets a solid A, not only for speed of shipment but for speed of receipt. DVD in perfect condition.",
