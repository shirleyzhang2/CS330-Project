            "input": "Hey Everyone.....had dinner there last night, 2/26.\\n\\nLOVED IT..\\n\\nThe restaurant itself, very downtown urban modern, clean, bathrooms were spotless at the time of my visit.\\n\\nReading other reviews there were several mentions of the Pretzels w/ the Fondue.  C'mon...pretzels and cheese, what's not to love.  This appetizer didn't disappoint, pretzels were hot and fresh, didn't have that 'just thawed' taste, the cheese sauce AWESOME!   We also had the white shrimp from the raw bar.  At $3 dollars a piece i thought was a little pricey, with that said they were terrific.  HUGE, plump and fresh, the taste was truly great.  My only bad thing to say about the shrimp was the 'shell on', had i thought to ask i would have asked that they peel the shrimp before brining it out.  It's a personal pet peeve of mine of having to take the shells off shrimp.  For out main meal we shared the Saturday night special which was baby back ribs and the grilled swordfish.  The swordfish was served with some kind of barely side dish, VERY good, the fish was terrific, would definitely get this again.  We were split on baby back ribs. They had a heavy char on them, which i loved my friend wasn't crazy about them but said they had a good flavor.  The meat literally fell off the both with almost no effort at all.\\n\\nThe service was very very good, our server Steph M, was very attentive w/o being intrusive, which can sometimes be a fine line.  Our drinks were NEVER empty, which is HUGE, we tend to drink a lot of iced tea while we eat.\\n\\nOn a side note, they have signs pointing for parking for the restaurant.  A sign at the exit of the elevators would be a great help.  \\n\\nCan't wait to go back.....i hope this place makes it!\\n\\nCiao everyone!",

My fav is still the cuban sandwich. the only cuban sandwich I like. It's not the most kid-friendly place but we were eating early so we took them. My 5 year old actually ate a southern fried oyster. He loved it! Can't wait to go back!",

Read some reviews on Yelp and thought,  what the heck,  try it. \\n\\nWalk in a the place is very cool inside lots of seating options.  At the sushi bar,  at the kitchen bar,  at the bar bar,  tables or patio.  Lively place too with music going a good \\\"\"crowd\\\"\" noise that isn't overbearing but you also don't feel like you're in a library either. We couldn't get a table without reservations but any of the bar seating was available. So we sat at the kitchen bar which was a bee hive of activity. Very cool. Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations. Drink choices were awesome! David went through the menu as fusion food can be overwhelming  with choices. We made a couple selections but thankfully David helped out with some.  The best way to order was what he recommended, family style and lots of dishes everyone eats from. The range of flavors from sushi to carnitas tacos is out of this world. The food was so incredible, not a bad choice (and I'll tell you I'm a pretty picky eater). The wait staff checked on us and brought food as ready.  \\n\\nEverything about Sumo Maya is top notch. If you go ask to sit in David's section if he's working. If you're willing, let him make recommendations and adjustments. Best waiter I've even had. Besides, with his haircut he has to be cool.....",

Security was extremely lazy in getting management when I wanted to speak to him. Finally he came and explained its the law I understand and respected that so I asked if I could just speak with my party for 5-10 minutes before i left since I drove there and they would not let me eat and was declined. Never going to recommend this place to anybody since not even a simple request could be made, I know it's the law but you can bend it a little for the customer and afford a 5-10 minute conversation.",
