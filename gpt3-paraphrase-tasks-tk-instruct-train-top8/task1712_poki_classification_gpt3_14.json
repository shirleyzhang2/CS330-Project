        "You are given a short poem which is written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Kids in grades 1-6 will be considered as in elementary school, and kids in grades 7-12 will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output, and no input will have both categories at the same time."
