        "In this task, you are given an utterance, which is a part of a conversation between a user and an agent. The user usually commands the agent to schedule events, retrieve event information, and check the schedule. The agent's response is an answer to the user's questions or follow-up questions on the user's command. Your job is to detect the speaker. Answer with \"User\" or \"Agent\"."
