        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains irony of some kind. Your task is to classify the type of irony the tweet has, and label it as \"polarity,\" \"situational,\" or \"other\" accordingly. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations; label these instances as \"situational.\" Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence; label these instances as \"polarity.\" There are other kinds of ironies that are neither polarity nor situational; label these instances as \"other.\" Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
