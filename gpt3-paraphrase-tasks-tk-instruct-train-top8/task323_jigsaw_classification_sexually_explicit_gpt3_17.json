It goes as follows...\nWords right out of a terrorist's mouth!!\nMasuma Khan posts on Facebook... \"White fragility can kiss my ass. Your white tears aren't sacred, your land is.\" This doesn't sound very Canadian to me, sounds more like the threat of a terrorist. We, real true Canadians, don't take kindly to threats... You think we are frail - we have a surprise for you! Watch out white people - this woman will stab you in the back without thinking twice.\nShe should not just face disciplinary action for her racist remark... she should be put on the \"Terrorist Watch List\". What she said was a direct threat to the white race .. who are we kidding??\nHer words are no different than those of the ISIS terrorist's who post their threats to the World Cup...\nAt least we white's know who our friends are .. definitely not her.\nKICK HER OUT!!",

Let me be frank: You don't give a rip what a 14-yr old Jewish boy may or may not have done in Eastern Europe seventy years ago. You care about this out-of-context quote from an old interview only because it enables you to marginalize the views of a man with whose politics you disagree.\n\nTherein lies the problem with these boards, if not the nature of political discourse writ large. For too many people of every political persuasion, information is valued only as it can be wielded as a cudgel. Facts are to be deployed not for achieving knowledge or respecting the views of others, but as malleable weapons used to vanquish a foe.\n\nIf those of us on the left who support Soros have to answer for his actions of 1944, then may I suggest you, Corbeil, JetRx et al. should have to shoulder the burdens of your man who grabs women by the pussy.",
