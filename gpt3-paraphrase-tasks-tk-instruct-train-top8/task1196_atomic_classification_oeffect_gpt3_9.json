        "In this task, you are given a tuple consisting of a Head and a Tail event, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head event, PersonY or others will be affected as mentioned in the Tail event. These effects are social actions that may occur after the Head event. For example, X may get hugged, and Y may blush in response. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
