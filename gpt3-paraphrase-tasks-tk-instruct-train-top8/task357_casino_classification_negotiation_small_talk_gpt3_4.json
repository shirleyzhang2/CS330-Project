    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. Small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip."

I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.'\nUtterance: 'Great that's an agreement for me'",
