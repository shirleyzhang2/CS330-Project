        "Given a target person and two sentences, your task is to determine the relationship between the sentences with respect to the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them. If the second sentence is a stereotype with respect to the first sentence and the target, output 'stereotype'. If the second sentence is an anti-stereotype with respect to the first sentence and the target, output 'anti-stereotype'. If the second sentence is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target, output 'unrelated'."
