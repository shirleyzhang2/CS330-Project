            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

State Sen. George Borrello, who made the comments in a statement on May 11, represents New York\u2019s 57th district, which includes three less-populated counties \u2014 Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua \u2014 south of more heavily populated regions near Buffalo (Erie County) and Niagara Falls (Niagara County). \"\"While infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our linkage with Erie County and its higher infection rates means that we don\u2019t meet the metrics for reopening, and our hurting, rural economies must remain shut down for at least another two weeks,\"\" Borrello said in the statement. The state\u2019s reopening plan allowed regions to begin Phase 1 of the reopening process on May 15 as long as they met seven metrics established by the state. The Western New York Region subsequently met all seven metrics on May 18 and entered Phase 1 the following day. But we wondered whether Borrello was correct in his May 11 statement that the infection rates in the three rural counties was substantially lower than those of the more urbanized counties to the north, and consistently among the state's lowest. We used the county-by-county infection tallies posted on Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s pressroom page and converted them to a rate per 10,000 residents. We ranked the counties from the highest to the lowest for each week from March 30 to mid-May, when Borrello made his statement. We found that, as Borrello had said, Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties ranked low in infection rates consistently over that period, while Erie and Niagara started higher and continued to rise: Our analysis found that Chautauqua never ranked higher than sixth from the bottom for infection rates among the 58 New York counties for which data was available, and Chautauqua had the lowest rate of any county for much of the period. Allegany and Cattaraugus ranked marginally higher than Chautauqua, but well below Erie and Niagara. Overall, the three small counties usually ranked in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time Borrello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. By contrast, Erie and Niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita. New York City (including all five boroughs) ranked at or near the top for the entire period. The state reopening plan mirrored what many other states are doing, with certain types of non-essential businesses opening in phases in each of 10 regions, as long as certain health measurements are met in the region. Borrello said in an interview that he just wants sensible reopening policies that are implemented \"\"fairly and equitably.\"\" \"\"Even though the infection rates are higher in Erie County than the rest of the region, we\u2019re still talking about keeping those same precautions and ensuring that they\u2019re being adhered to,\"\" he said. Borrello said that \"\"infection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state.\"\" A look at the data from the end of March to mid-May confirms that the infection rate in each of the three counties was usually in the bottom one-third of counties in the state, and by the time Borello made his statement, they were all in the bottom one-fifth of counties. By contrast, Erie and Niagara were consistently in the top half of counties as measured by infections per capita.\" Claim: \u201cInfection rates in Allegany, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties have consistently been among the lowest in the state.\u201d",

            "input": "Paragraph: Extinction Rebellion, which uses civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and the accelerating loss of plant and animal species, is midway through a new two-week wave of actions in cities around the world. Activists thronged the financial heart of London on Monday, unfurling banners, addressing passersby by megaphone or blocking streets around locations including BlackRock, the Bank of England, Bank of China and Barclays. At BlackRock, volunteers glued themselves to the doors while others staged a mock dinner party with rolled-up banknotes on their plates. Police said they arrested more than 90 people. The arrestees included Rabbi Jeffrey Newman of the Finchley Reform Synagogue, who was arrested near the Bank of England praying, singing and wearing a prayer shawl for the first day of the Jewish festival Sukkot, Extinction Rebellion said. \u201cThe City of London is a preeminent nexus of power in the global system that is killing our world,\u201d said Carolina Rosa, spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion. BlackRock declined to comment. Police later ordered a halt to all assembly linked to   Extinction Rebellion in London. At Trafalgar Square in the heart of the city, where demonstrators have pitched camp for the past week amid fountains at the base of Nelson\u2019s Column, protesters began removing tents. Police made no immediate move to shut down another main protest camp in the district of Vauxhall. \u201cOfficers have begun the process of clearing Trafalgar Square and getting things back to normal,\u201d said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor. Extinction Rebellion said it had left Trafalgar Square but would continue actions in London and cities around the world. \u201cThe Climate and Ecological Emergency isn\u2019t going away and we remain resolute in facing it. We urge the Government and the authorities to join us in doing the same,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThis is bigger than all of us.\u201d   Extinction Rebellion wants to cause enough disruption to force governments to rapidly cut carbon emissions and reverse the collapse of ecosystems to avert the worst of the devastation scientists project if business as usual continues. Critics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would follow, and that the world needs fossil fuels. Extinction Rebellion said that more than 1,400 people had been arrested in London since it launched its latest actions a week ago. A similar number has in total been arrested in 20 cities in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. While activists have long targeted fossil fuel companies, a growing global climate protest movement is increasingly scrutinizing the role fund managers, banks and insurance companies play in enabling oil and gas extraction. Emily Grossman, a British science broadcaster who has a PhD in molecular biology, who joined the protest outside BlackRock, said that financing fossil fuel projects was undermining the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming. \u201cThis is criminal damage that they are doing to our lives and to the lives of our children and it has to stop,\u201d said Grossman, who was later led away by police. Major oil companies have approved $50 billion of projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published last month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. Fossil fuel companies say they need to invest in new projects to meet future demand for energy, particularly in fast-growing regions such as Asia. Climate protesters want to pressure index fund firms such as BlackRock because the sector, which now controls half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, has enormous power to influence companies in which they invest trillions of dollars. The leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout, a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records found this month.

The ban, which was due to start on Friday, will remain on ice until at least Oct. 18 when the Supreme Court in Albany is scheduled to hear the case brought by industry trade group Vapor Technology Association arguing for a preliminary injunction on the ban. \u201cWe are very pleased with the New York State Appellate Division\u2019s decision, which acknowledges the strength of our claims about the State\u2019s executive overreach, and which preserves the ability of hundreds of small businesses to remain open and continue to serve their adult customers,\u201d Tony Abboud, executive director of the association said in an emailed statement. New York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said he remained confident the ban would eventually be enforced. \u201cMake no mistake: this is a public health emergency that demands immediate action to help ensure the wellbeing of our children, and we\u2019re confident that once the court hears our argument they will agree,\u201d Zucker said in a statement. A handful of states have imposed or are eyeing similar bans as the crisis grows and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people stop using vaping products. Governors in Michigan and Rhode Island have announced sales restrictions, while Massachusetts imposed an outright ban for four months while it examined potential new regulations. Ohio\u2019s state governor this week urged lawmakers to pass a ban. U.S. health officials earlier on Thursday reported 18 deaths due to a mysterious lung illness linked to e-cigarettes and other vaping products and said the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition now exceeds 1,000. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also on Thursday ordered several e-cigarette companies, including Juul Labs Inc and Nu Mark, to turn over sales and advertising data, in the first sign of a likely probe of their marketing practices. Tobacco giant Altria Group Inc owns Nu Mark and has a 35% stake in Juul. Abboud noted that New York state lawmakers had already raised the minimum age for the purchase of vapor products from 18 to 21 from November and imposed a tax increase. He said the lobby group was ready to work with officials \u201cto achieve the twin goals of restricting youth vaping, which already is illegal, and preserving flavored alternatives for adults desperately trying to quit smoking.\u201d  The New York state Department of Health had pledged to provide retailers with a two-week grace period before conducting site visits to enforce the ban on all flavored e-cigarettes besides tobacco and menthol.

Patty, who has worked at her father\u2019s restaurant for 27 years, now struggles to handle full-time duties. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get disability, but I\u2019ve been denied once already. I don\u2019t plan on quitting working. I just need help. I need help because I can\u2019t do a full-time job,\u201d Patty said. In March 2017, a friend who lives in New Mexico, where medical marijuana is legal, mailed her Buddha Tears, a cannabis oil product containing cannabidiol (CBD), and THC, the psychotropic component of cannabis. After consuming a tiny amount of the oil each day \u2014 as well as smoking marijuana \u2014 Patty said she saw a massive improvement in her condition. \u201cUnfortunately, I have to smoke everyday, because if I don\u2019t, I will be in the bathroom all the time,\u201d said Patty, who asked that her last name not be published because she is using an illegal substance. But these days, Patty is again struggling with the symptoms. \u201cMy connection (for CBD and marijuana) got cut off,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very angry.\u201d While Patty and others have found success treating their medical ailments with cannabis, the drug remains illegal in Wisconsin. And because of its status as a Schedule I drug \u2014 the most restrictive classification \u2014 there has been limited research in the United States about its effectiveness as medicine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized one component of cannabis to treat serious and rare seizure disorders, as well as three drugs with synthetic cannabis substances; no other uses have been approved. ___ The nonprofit news outlet Wisconsin Watch provided this article to The Associated Press through a collaboration with Institute for Nonprofit News. ___ Although it remains illegal federally, 33 states and the District of Columbia have authorized medical use of cannabis. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed legalizing it for medical use in Wisconsin, and another group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill in October to decriminalize possession of less than 28 grams. But Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, remains opposed. An April poll conducted by the Marquette Law School Poll showed that 83% of registered voters polled support the use of marijuana for medical purposes with a doctor\u2019s prescription. \u201cWhen issues receive more than 70% support from registered voters in Wisconsin, the Legislature needs to listen and act,\u201d said Rep. David Bowen, D-Milwaukee. According to Dr. Angela Janis, director of psychiatry for University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s University Health Services, Schedule I drugs, including marijuana, are considered to have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, whereas for Schedule II drugs, there is less potential for abuse, and there is some therapeutic benefit. Janis is intimately familiar with this distinction. In addition to her university job, Janis is chief medical officer at LeafLine Labs, a Minnesota-based medical marijuana company. \u201cTo put this in perspective: methamphetamine is Schedule II because it\u2019s approved for obesity. Cocaine is Schedule II because it\u2019s approved for nasal surgery since it can constrict your blood vessels as they do surgery in your nose. So that\u2019s the bar for what \u2018medical benefit\u2019 means,\u201d Janis said. According to Janis, cannabis has less abuse potential than any of those substances. \u201cCannabis is not appropriately scheduled. And that\u2019s one of the barriers, but not the only barrier, to research,\u201d Janis said. Janis recommends rescheduling the drug so researchers can further study its properties. Even Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), which opposes marijuana legalization, is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of drugs containing cannabis that have been approved by the FDA, said Colton Grace, a spokesman for the group. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, cannabinoids are substances within the cannabis plant that act on specific receptors in the human brain and body. They are the main active ingredients in the medical products derived from cannabis. These receptors affect many essential functions, including one\u2019s memory, thinking, concentration and coordination. Interfering with it can have profound effects \u2014 both positive and negative. Two of the most extensively studied cannabinoids are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD. However, there are dozens of cannabinoids that may also have medical uses. \u201cMany strains of the cannabis plant can have 60, 70, 80 cannabinoids in them that all interact in different ways,\u201d Janis said. The National Institutes of Health reported spending $191 million on researching cannabinoids for medicinal use in 2017-18. Some effects are already known. For example, THC can affect the central nervous system, producing benefits such as decreased vomiting and nausea, increased appetite, reduced pain and anti-inflammatory effects. CBD also acts as an anti-inflammatory, increasing immune function, reducing pain and keeping certain cells from proliferating. Cannabinoid receptors are not in areas that control breathing, which is why there are no fatal overdoses with marijuana, Janis said. CBD actually blocks the psychotropic effects of THC, Janis said. In addition to all those cannabinoids, the cannabis sativa plant has a lot of other chemicals. For instance, terpenes, which give each strain its particular smell, such as lemon or pine, \u201care thought to have a lot of effects, but we just don\u2019t know what they actually do in the body,\u201d Janis said. In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine came out with one of the most comprehensive reviews of scientific research on what is known about the health effects of cannabis and cannabis-derived products. The committee considered more than 10,000 scientific abstracts. It reached nearly 100 conclusions, finding substantial evidence for just a few indications \u2014 the biggest one being pain. The report found there is substantial evidence that cannabis is an effective treatment for chronic pain in adults, specifically nerve pain, Janis said. The group also found conclusive evidence for cannabis treating chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and MS-associated muscle spasms. The report also showed moderate evidence that cannabis or cannabinoids are effective for improving sleep in individuals with sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, chronic pain and multiple sclerosis. It also found limited evidence for cannabis as effective for increasing appetite and decreasing weight loss associated with HIV/AIDS, relaxing muscle tightness and pain from MS, symptoms of Tourette syndrome, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anecdotal evidence has also proven the effectiveness of cannabinoids for treating Rett syndrome. Norah Lowe, 10, started feeling relief from the rare neurological disorder one year ago when she began using CBD to treat her symptoms. Rett syndrome impacts nearly every part of a child\u2019s life, including the ability to speak, walk, eat and breathe. A distinct feature of the condition is repetitive, almost constant hand movements. At a news conference arranged by state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, to introduce her latest bill to legalize medical and recreational marijuana, Norah\u2019s father, Josh Lowe, said he is frustrated that state law prohibits her from trying medical marijuana, which has helped others with her condition. Norah, who uses a wheelchair, has experienced \u201cincreased flexibility, decreased pain and muscle cramping, increased communication, cognitive ability, reduction in seizures, better mood control, and the list goes on and on,\u201d Lowe said. A 2017 study published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews analyzed several studies, concluding that cannabis-based medicines were better than placebos for pain relief \u2014 and that these medications also improved sleep and psychological distress \u2014 it concluded that any potential benefits might be outweighed by their potential harms. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, the most common conditions accepted by states that allow medicinal cannabis relate to the relief of the symptoms of cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS and MS. Some other common indicators include Alzheimer\u2019s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s disease and PTSD, according to the group, which advocates for marijuana legalization. Additionally, the University of Michigan published a study in the February issue of Health Affairs to understand the reasons why people are using cannabis for medical purposes, and whether those purposes are evidence-based. The authors found that 85.5% t of uses of medical cannabis were for conditions for which there was substantial or conclusive evidence of their therapeutic effectiveness. Even more, they found that chronic pain is currently the most common qualifying condition reported by medical cannabis patients, used by 64.9% of such patients in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s a good sign,\u201d Janis said. \u201cEven though a physician can write it (a cannabis prescription) for a variety of things, it seems to be being used for what it\u2019s intended for.\u201d Since cannabis is a Schedule I drug, it is \u201cvery difficult to study at any institutional level\u201d because, in order to do so, researchers need sign-offs from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, which has \u201chistorically been unwilling to provide them,\u201d said David Abernathy, vice president of data and government affairs for the Arcview Group, a firm that advises investors in the cannabis industry. Because of this, \u201cThings like double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials weren\u2019t happening in the U.S.,\u201d Abernathy said. But there has been a lot of research in the past decade in other countries including Israel, Canada, China and Italy, and \u201cnow we\u2019re starting to see more research in the U.S.,\u201d he said. The 2017 National Academies review of cannabis research agreed that the drug\u2019s status as a Schedule I substance made it hard to study. \u201cResearchers also often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions,\u201d the review found. Patty, the Crohn\u2019s patient, believes that her cannabis treatment not only alleviated her Crohn\u2019s symptoms, but she credits it with keeping her aggressive skin cancer at bay. According to a 2018 article published in Biochemical Pharmacology, studies have shown the potential of cannabinoids to reduce of skin cancer progression. However, there is a significant lack of clinical studies promising enough to make any conclusive statements at this time. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the cannabis oil since March of 2018, and once I couldn\u2019t get it anymore, I mean I just finished my 12th surgery (for cancer),\u201d Patty said. \u201cSo, you tell me, what do you think?\u201d Claim: Wisconsin residents using medical cannabis amid restrictions.",

The\u00a0story does\u00a0not provide any information about the\u00a0cost of orlistat, the\u00a0cost of the food\u00a0in the\u00a0study diets, or the cost of the counseling provided to study participants. A quotation from one of the study researchers suggests\u00a0that\u00a0a low-carb diet might be a\u00a0cheaper alternative to a low-fat diet plus medication. While this is certainly\u00a0possible, it also seems possible that low-carb eating,\u00a0with its emphasis on protein from\u00a0meat,\u00a0would be more expensive than low-fat eating, and that this would cancel out any savings on medication. In any case,\u00a0making any kind of judgment in this area would require\u00a0more hard data, but\u00a0the story provides only speculation. The story earns points for noting the absolute reduction in blood pressure in each group. We wish, though, that it had provided the weight loss in similar terms of actual\u00a0pounds or kilograms lost instead of as a percentage of bodyweight. Similar to the HealthDay piece, the story provides no information about the potential adverse effects of orlistat or a low-carbohydrate diet. Similar to the HealthDay piece,\u00a0the story gives a decent overview of\u00a0the basic study design and outcomes. However more information would have helped us judge\u00a0how well these diet plans might work in the real world. There is\u00a0no information on who dropped out of the study or how well the two groups were able to adhere to the diet. In addition, the story states that low-carb dieters were advised to consume 20 g of carbohydrate per day, but it\u00a0seems very unlikely that participants were able to maintain that level of carbohydrate restriction for almost a year. Overall, this story squeaks by with a satisfactory. The story does not exaggerate the prevalence or consequences of obesity. The story\u2019s only quotes come from Dr. Yancy, a researcher affiliated with the study. The story also does not inform\u00a0readers that Dr. Yancy and another co-author on the study have received funding from the Robert C. Atkins Foundation, which promotes\u00a0research on low-carb diets. Given the story\u2019s focus on blood pressure, it\u00a0should have mentioned how the results of this study might compare to treatment with blood pressure medication. The\u00a0story mentioned that\u00a0orlistat, the weight loss medication tested in the study,\u00a0is the active ingredient in Xenical and\u00a0Alli. Unlike the competing piece in HealthDay, however, it did not specify that Xenical is a prescription drug and that Alli is available over the counter. Although this information would have been helpful, providing the trade names for both drugs is probably enough to orient most readers. The story mentions that both low-carb and low-fat diets are proven to produce weight loss. However, it suggests that we should be surprised that a low-carbohydrate diet could produce such beneficial effects on blood pressure. In fact, this effect was well-documented in another comparison\u00a0of weight loss diets\u00a0published in JAMA in 2007. The story lifts two quotes directly from a news release put out by Duke University. While the story admits that\u00a0the quotes\u00a0came from\u00a0a release,\u00a0it doesn\u2019t\u00a0perform\u00a0the basic task of finding another source to provide an alternate\u00a0viewpoint. The reader is left wondering if this is journalism or simply an extension of the Duke University press office. Claim: Low-Carb Diet Lowers Blood Pressure",

He provided Communion at the 11:15 a.m. services. Church officials said he appeared healthy that day and had been regularly washing his hands. But he had been ill in late February [2020].There was no immediate estimate of how many people came into close contact with him on the other targeted days.Bowser emphasized self-quarantine was crucial to stop the virus from spreading, adding that officials recognized that \u201cthere will be hardships for many people not just in D.C., but in Maryland and Virginia\u201d due to the restriction. The newspaper also reported that Cole engaged in no recent international travel, visiting only the church conference in Kentucky on February 22 2020.CBS News obtained a copy of the email issued to parishioners about Cole\u2019s diagnosis:In an email to parishioners obtained by CBS News, Cole confirmed he has tested positive, and said services were suspended \u201cout of an abundance of caution for the most vulnerable among us.\u201d All services were canceled Sunday, the first time the church has closed since a fire in the 1800s, [Reverend Crystal] Hardin said.\u201cI can now confirm that I am the individual who tested positive for the Coronavirus,\u201d Cole wrote in his email. \u201cFirst, I want to assure you that I will be okay. I am receiving excellent care and am in good spirits under the circumstances. I will remain quarantined for the next 14 days as will the rest of my family.\u201dCBS further reported that public health officials assessed the exposure risk posed by Cole, concluding that visiting the church was sufficient to warrant quarantine:The D.C. Department of Health said in a statement that it has been in contact with the church and \u201cdetermined an individual\u2019s visitation to Christ Church Georgetown warrants precautionary measures.\u201d The department recommended \u201ca temporary pause of services\u201d and said it was \u201cconducting an intensive investigation to identify any exposures to COVID-19 that may have occurred at the church,\u201d referring to the virus.Anyone who visited the church under any circumstances or for any reason within a specific date range was affected by the self-quarantine.

            "input": "Paragraph: \"Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure. But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion. \"\"When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010,\"\" he says on his official congressional website. \"\"Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.\"\" Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009. When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million. That\u2019s a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited. But it\u2019s only part of the story. First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or \"\"saved\"\" as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources. The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally. But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, \"\"do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the law\u2019s impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower...\"\"  Among the reasons is that \"\"some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus,\"\" and that the reports do not \"\"attempt to measure\"\" the number of indirect jobs. Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the law\u2019s impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why. \"\"Evaluating the impact,\"\" said the report, which was the sixth in a series, \"\" \u2026 is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy.\"\" Separately, the council\u2019s report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. Oregon\u2019s acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics. \"\"This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get,\"\" he said. He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011. Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011. Economists say there\u2019s another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that aren\u2019t touched by the stimulus. There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel. The White House and supporters factor those \"\"saved\"\" jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not. Got it? It\u2019s all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true. But Walden\u2019s context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say it\u2019s impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were \"\"created or saved,\"\" as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And it\u2019s clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus. Walden\u2019s assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.\" Claim: \"Greg Walden Says the federal stimulus program was ineffective because \"\"the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.\"",

Watch What Appears On The Skin\u2026 GROSS!\u201d) which held that the wax used to preserve fruits are riddled with pesticides: Apples are so healthy and delicious, it really is no wonder that they\u2019re such a popular snack. All you have to do is give them a quick wash and pack them, right? After watching this video, maybe not. Apparently, many producers will coat their apples with wax to help preserve the fruit. This is particularly true for apples found at grocery stores. Some experts say that wax is harmless, as it\u2019s not digested by our system. But others argue that the real danger lies in the pesticide residue that the wax may have trapped in. Next time you buy apples, it might be worth finding out just how much wax coating there is. Want to get rid of the wax? Try scrubbing your apples in a bath of warm water, lemon juice, and baking soda! The post\u00a0linked to\u00a0a January 2016 YouTube video, during which a person uses boiling water to remove the wax from apples. That person claimed waxed apples cause cancer: Be Careful when eating apples. Please don\u2019t eat the skin of the apples because it\u2019s coated with wax. Check before you eat many of the fruits. Wax is being used for preservation purposes and cold storage. You might be surprised especially apples from USA and other parts are more than one year old, though it would look fresh. Becox wax is coated, preventing bacteria to enter. So it does not get dry. Please Eat Apples after removing the wax. In the clip, the individual gave no information to substantiate the claim. He also noted that the apples \u201cchanged color\u201d when exposed to boiling water, a procedure familiar\u00a0to many\u00a0viewers, and which is most commonly described as \u201ccooking.\u201d (Apples are\u00a0not the only fruits that darken in color when exposed to direct and sustained heat.) The clip\u2019s initial fallacy hinged on the implication that wax on apples was a little-known secret. However, according to\u00a0the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration, waxed produce is\u00a0widely, openly available and safe [PDF]: Many vegetables and fruits make their own natural waxy coating. After harvest, fresh produce may be washed to clean off dirt and soil \u2014 but such washing also removes the natural wax. Therefore, waxes are applied to some produce to replace the natural waxes that are lost. Wax coatings help retain moisture to maintain quality from farm to table \u2026 Waxes also help inhibit mold growth, protect produce from bruising, prevent other physical damage and disease, and enhance appearance[.] The Produce Marketing Association (an international trade group) reiterated the FDA\u2019s explanation of waxed apples and other produce items. The PMA also explained that the substances used are always\u00a0subject to strict FDA scrutiny, and are safe to eat even when whitened due to exposure to extreme temperatures. That document outlined guidelines for use of wax on produce in general: Many fresh fruits and vegetables make their own natural waxy coating to help retain moisture. Extensive washing at the packinghouse removes this natural wax, so waxes are applied to some produce items to replace the natural ones that are lost. Each piece of waxed produce only has a drop or two of wax. Waxes may be mixed with water or other wetting agents to ensure they are applied thinly and evenly. Waxes help retain the fruit\u2019s or vegetable\u2019s moisture during shipping and marketing. Waxes also help to inhibit mold growth, to protect fruits and vegetables from bruising, to prevent other physical damage and disease, and to enhance appearance. By protecting against moisture loss, wax coatings help fresh fruits and vegetables maintain wholesomeness and freshness. Waxing does not improve the quality of any inferior fruit or vegetables; rather, waxing \u2014 along with proper handling \u2014 contributes to maintaining a healthful product \u2026 Commodities that may have coatings applied include apples, avocados, bell peppers, cantaloupes, cucumbers, eggplants, grapefruits, lemons, limes, melons, oranges, parsnips, passion fruit, peaches, pineapples, pumpkins, rutabagas, squash, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, turnips, and yucca. However, they are not always waxed. Waxes by themselves do not control decay; rather, they may be combined with some chemicals to prevent the growth of mold. The safety and use of these substances are strictly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Coatings used on fruits and vegetables must meet the food additive regulations of the FDA. Extensive research by governmental and scientific authorities has shown that approved waxes are safe to eat. Waxes are indigestible, which means they go through the body without breaking down or being absorbed. FDA requires wax labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables that have been treated with postharvest wax or resin coatings. Consumers will see signs in produce departments that read: \u201cCoated with food-grade vegetable-, petroleum-, beeswax-, and/or shellac-based wax or resin, to maintain freshness\u201d followed by a list of the commodity (-ies) coated with these waxes or resins). In today\u2019s marketplace, none of these coatings is animal-based, and they all come from natural sources. Packaged fresh fruits and vegetables that have information on the label (such as the product name, weight or brand) must also be labeled for wax or resin coatings by the packer, repacker, or shipper. The topic also was addressed by food safety experts at Best Food Facts. According to their\u00a0analysis, not only do apples often produce their own wax (dependent on crop variables), but that an apple\u2019s natural wax contained a component that inhibits (not encourages) cancer cell growth: Remember, apples are alive even after they are picked and will continue to live, provided they have the sufficient resources and an acceptable environment. The waxy coating produced by the apple and found on its skin protects it. The waxy coating can appear milky sometimes, but if you rub it gently, you can actually get it to it shine. The natural wax on the fruit of the apple contains about fifty individual components belonging to at least half a dozen chemical groups. The major cyclic component of apple fruit wax is called ursolic acid and is highly water-repellent. Research has shown that ursolic acid is capable of inhibiting various types of cancer cells and can serve as a starting material for synthesis of more potent bioactive compounds such as antitumor agents. Apples weren\u2019t always coated with additional wax, as they often are\u00a0harvested with a natural coating of wax. However, all wax used on apples is\u00a0subject to FDA guidelines for food safe additives, and none of the \u201cwaxed apples cause cancer\u201d claims we found included\u00a0a single known carcinogen commonly used in the process. Waxing apples is\u00a0widely deemed both a safe and often natural occurrence, and the use of wax to coat apples is neither a secret nor credible health risk. While there are some credible concerns about harmful pesticides caught in the wax used to coat apples and other fruits and vegetables, there are easy ways to avoid or minimize the risk of ingesting them. According to the National Pesticide Information Center, a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Environmental Protection Agency, most pesticide residues can be removed by rinsing fruits with water or scrubbing them with a soft brush. More information about what pesticides are in the food supply and how to avoid them can be found in this March 2015\u00a0report. However, the\u00a0overall risks of pesticide residue are quite low, even with conventionally grown produce, and since the Food Quality Protection Act was passed in 1996, very tightly regulated in the United States. However,\u00a0wax on an apple is not a visual representation of trapped pesticides, nor is it an indication that any chemicals or toxic substances are present. Claim: Waxed apples cause cancer.",
