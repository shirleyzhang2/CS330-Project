        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. The second sentence will be missing, and you will be given a candidate sentence to fill in the blank. You need to determine if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it does, output \"Yes\". If it does not, output \"No\". The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
