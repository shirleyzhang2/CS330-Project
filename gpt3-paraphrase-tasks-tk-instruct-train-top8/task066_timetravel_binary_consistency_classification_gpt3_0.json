        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You will also be given a candidate sentence for the second sentence, and you will need to determine if it connects the first sentence to the rest of the story. If it does, indicate your answer as \"Yes\". Otherwise, indicate your answer as \"No\". If the given sentence changes the subsequent storyline in a way that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story, it is considered incorrect."
