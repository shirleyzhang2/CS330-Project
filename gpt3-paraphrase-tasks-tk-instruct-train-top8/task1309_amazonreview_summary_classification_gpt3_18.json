Very obvious that this phone was previously water damaged. The phone also had near chunks missing from the corners-- which I would have been able to get over if the screen was okay. But it wasn't. Not desperate enough to keep this phone. I'd rather spend a little more and not have a phone that was not obviously abused by the previous owner. Oh, and they make you pay for the return shipping.
