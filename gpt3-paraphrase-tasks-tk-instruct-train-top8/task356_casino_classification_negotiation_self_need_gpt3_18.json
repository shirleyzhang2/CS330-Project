    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output No. The self-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation. For example, a participant might point out that they sweat a lot to show preference towards water packages."

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
