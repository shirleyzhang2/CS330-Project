However just randomly after a month or two I turned it on one day and I have very noticeable blue tint to the screen and a blue line down the left side. My guess is the monitor overheated while playing overwatch for almost an entire day, nevertheless this is unacceptable quality. I contacted support and was greeted with barely english speaking people who were not knowledgeable about the product at all, and couldn't even get my name right after telling them over 5 different times how it is spelled. I will try to return it and get it replaced, but going two weeks without my monitor is unacceptable when it is clearly a manufacturing error. I have tried other computers and other cables and have determined it is definitely the monitors issue. We will see how support handles this, will definitely be getting a warranty next time so this headache is Amazon's problem. \n Summary: used to be instant code!! it is not anymore in my case",
