I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

I got another travel white noise machine on Amazon that looked like a little bunny and it\u2019s nice and loud. I don\u2019t know why this machine is so quiet.

I didn't have high hopes of getting much bass out of them, but once mounted in the ceiling with some fiberglass insulation over them I must admit I was fairly impressed! These speakers will not blow the windows out of your house, but the clarity is there with some decent bass and that's all I really care about! ***UPDATE*** Was so happy with the first set I bought another on Sept. 2018. The controller went bad 13 months after I got it and yep, sorry you are out of warranty! Pyle wanted me to buy the controller. Do yourself a favor and look at some other better products out there and with a better warranty! \n Category: toy",
