We were greeted by the bartender whom we ended up feeling very sorry for by the end of our experience. Not only was she the only bartender but was the cook as well. We were soon informed that the website wasn't correct because the owner hasn't updated it. Also, many of the items on the menu weren't available because the owner hasn't been around as he just had a baby. We ordered a pizza and wings to go and a couple of bloody Mary's while we waited. The drinks were good but the bartender was working hard because of other patrons and our food order. I overheard the bartender let other patrons know that she was out of their preferred alcohol. Now the food: the \\\"\"pizza\\\"\" was a small flat bread that got cold really fast and was served in a box usually reserved for an extra large pizza. The food is mediocre at best and there are much cooler bars to hang at downtown. Sorry, I just can't recommend to anyone. The bartender was nice though, she just didn't have the tools to do her job.",

He charges so little compared to other grooming services in Las Vegas, but the quality of the service is right on par with the rest.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

            "input": "This was my second visit to Holder, but my first review.  The temp outside was a wonderful 18 degrees as we strolled from our hotel to the restaurant only a block up the street (thank goodness).  The dining room was warm and inviting as we hung our parkas in the coat room.  There is a good variety of banket, center table and bar seating.  There are wonderful copper accents in the room and the lighting is an interesting pattern of iridescent glass and metal. \\n\\nMy choices from the menu were simple and rustic which fit my desire for comfort food due to the cold weather.   I started with a Grey Goose dirty martini, and my normal 3 olives...the olives were not the usual gigantor ones served locally here in NOVA, these were quite petite and as I bit into my first one off the skewer I realized it was not pitted!  I don't mind, but it helps to know ahead...and let's face it spitting those out in your hand isn't too graceful in public.  But the bartender did my drink justice...dry and oh so dirty, and the glass was full...yummm.\\n\\nMy starter was a vegetable soup with a great beefy tomato broth as the base, nice touch of sage in the background, salted and peppered to perfection.  The veggies were rough chopped including scallions, zucchini, chunks of tomato, petite lima beans and julienne mushrooms. The steaming bowl was topped with fresh shaved parmesean.\\n\\nMain course consisted of beef cheeks (no, not the ones you sit on silly) bourguignon style.  This is classic French cooking...this method slowly simmers the beef in wine which tenderizes cuts of meat that would have been too tough to cook any other way.  The flavor of carrots, garlic and onions came shining through in the wonderful sauce that draped over the mashed potatoes like a velvet sheath.  Simply paired with the beef and mashers were haricovert....green beans folks!  I tried to figure out if the chef had actually used a burgundy, as the rich sauce could have been done with a good cabernet instead.\\n\\nAll in all the meal was everything I wanted that evening and since I'm headed to Montreal on a regular basis I will probably go again.  The nice thing here is that the staff instantly recognizes us Americans and quickly opts out your French menu for one in English....Merci!",

OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/",

Customers get confused what line to stand in because the buffet and cafe are located right next to each other.  The hostess was rather rude...yelled across the room for the party ahead of us instead of greeting nicely and showing the party to their table.  The seating areas were very dirty...carpet needed cleaning last year, food dropped on floor and not picked up by staff, carpet had large rip that I tripped over.  Peel and eat shrimp were not cleaned well.  Bread rolls still in plastic bags instead of served in baskets.  For an International Buffet, I thought the food selection was not good.  Sneeze guards were placed really low so the food was hard to get to and they were dirty with smeared food.  One of the worst buffets we have been to in a long time.",

If you've ever had a Detroit Coney Island hot dog you know this is one unique dish, and coupled with the Detroit Coney Burger it makes one hell of a meal.  The unusual chili sauce that tops both the loose meat burger and the hot dog, along with yellow mustard and onions makes them stand out among all other hot dogs and burgers. \\nWhen I left Michigan several years ago I thought I'd never see another Detroit Coney Dog and then.......thank you God!!!\\n\\nIf you miss Detroit, stop by and grab a Vernor's Ginger Ale, or Faygo Rock and Rye, another one of the things I  miss about the Motor City.  \\n\\nI posted a photo of my latest venture to Detroit Motor City Coney Dogs.",

We had the chicken parm- soggy, super salty blegh! And also a shrimp pasta..also salty salty salty! I didn't know they were catering to goats? Or maybe the clientele here is so over the hill that their taste buds have gone? It was sub par food at best-3 entrees one cocktail, one app, over $100!!! Garlic Olive oil  brought out in cheesy metal ketchup containers, old outdated silverware and china, outdated and sad decor.  No thanks!!! I would not recommend it at all.",
