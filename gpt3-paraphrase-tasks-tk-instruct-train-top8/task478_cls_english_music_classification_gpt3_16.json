I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.    Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.    The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).    Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).    P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter.",

            "input": "Great Overview (But Sometimes A Difficult Listen) . While the idea to make a collection of the fall out of punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s after the great No Thanks box is a really interesting idea yet it proves extremely hard to pull off. Why? Well when punk became new wave and hardcore became alternative, you were left with so many sounds, so many viewpoints. While it totally made the music scene much more interesting compiling it to 4 discs makes it a hard listen sometimes because of that collage of styles. So its a great learning experience for the uninitiated to learn from, and its a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up with this music. For those of us in the middle we are left kinda scratching our chins and flipping over some of the tracks. I must say however that Rhino did choose the prime cuts from each group, and chose the right groups from each scene but thats what Rhino is great at archival material. Its by no means a bad box set in fact its really quite the opposite, but I guarantee even the most open minded listeners will find themselves hitting the skip button past their first listen",

He was without question a musical genius whose depth of soul is reflected in every note and word he sings. In this early music one can already hear that longing, that love which so touches the listener. His voice is not great, but the feeling it conveys goes well beyond what is ordinarily given in most singing. He has the holy in him, the nearness to and longing for G-d. And he conveys that to us, so sweetly, so beautifully.   Oy heilegen Shlomo what would we do without your music?",

This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, \"Sacred Love\" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may",

This is exactly what I've been looking to fit my eclectic taste. All the hits are here, this side of Great Balls of Fire and Willie and the Hand Jive. Those two would have made this compilation perfect, but perfection is hard to come by when dealing with era compilations.     I wasn't around back when these songs were blasting on the radio, but I grew up listening to this music - thanks, mom! If you want to experience the sound of this era, this three-set cd collection is perfect. I've been looking for Maybellene, Be-Bop-A-Lula, Peggy Sue, Sea Cruise and Blue Suede Shoes and they're all here on the same set!    Try ebay before you buy here. I found this set relatively cheap over there. There were about five sellers when I bought mine, all vying for the lowest price.      This is great road music for those of you in my generation brave enough to try something new and break away from the Death Cab for Cutie/Outkast conformity we hear all the time on mainstream radio.     For those of you who grew up on this stuff, please let me reintroduce you to your old friends. This cd has almost all of them.",

            "input": "Fully developed Canterbury sound . This excellent 1975 album shows Hatfield & the North adopting a full blown Canterbury rock sound - a nice mixture of quirky prog and jazz rock.  Although folks refer to a Canterbury style before 1975 (I include myself here too), the bands lumped under the Canterbury style pre-1975 were incredibly disparate and utilized a broad spectrum of musical styles.  The Henry Cow (experimental) - Caravan (pop prog) continuum comes to mind in fact.  It was not until the mid-1970s however, that a distinct Canterbury sound emerged (quirky, proggy, jazz rock) and this album is a superb example.    The core lineup includes a virtual who's who of Canterbury rock: Phil Miller (guitars); drummer Pip Pyle; Richard Sinclair (vocals, bass guitar); and Dave Stewart (Hammond organ, electric piano, tone generator.  The additional musicians are also among the Canterbury luminaries and include Jimmy Hastings (flute, soparano and tenor saxophone); Mont Campbell (French horn); Lindsay Cooper (oboe and bassoon); Tim Hodgkinson (clarinet), and finally the Northettes (Barbara Gaskin, Amanda Parsons, and Ann Rosenthal).  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and the individual performances are breathtaking.  The ensemble work is also very intricate and there are some fairly dexterous meter shifts.  I feel that Richard Sinclair's vocals (and bass playing) are both excellent and it is always a treat to hear him perform whether with Caravan, Hatfield & the North, or Camel.    The nine tracks on the album are arranged into two largish suites, including tracks 1-8 and the massive 20'13 Mumps suite.  As I mentioned, although progressive rock is the dominant style, there is a good bit of jazz rock.  In fact, there may be slightly more jazz rock than was found on the 1974 debut.  There is also the whimsical Canterburian sense of humor - I think this is also a distinctive feature of the Canterbury \"thing\".  Greater emphasis is placed on instrumental sections and lengthy \"jams\" are scattered across the album, where Dave and Phil really get a chance to shine.  The Northettes also add a very nice, dreamy touch to each piece, and the woodwind playing, (especially Jimmy's flute work), heighten this effect.  There are also brief experimental sections too - the last few minutes of Fitter Stoke has a Bath is a good example of this.  Overall, although I don't feel that Rotter's Club is much different than the debut, some folks might notice a bit of more of a jazz rock approach.      The bonus tracks include alternate takes of Big John Wayne Socks Psychology on the Jaw and Chaos at the Greasy Spoon, in addition to the extremely jazzy track Halfway between Heaven and Earth, the thunderous (it is unbelievably heavy) Oh, Len's Nature!, and the once again very jazz-rocky Lying and Gracing (it sounds live but there is no indication of where it was recorded).  These last three tracks are superb.    All in all, this is an excellent Hatfield & the North album and is highly recommended along with the 1973 debut",
