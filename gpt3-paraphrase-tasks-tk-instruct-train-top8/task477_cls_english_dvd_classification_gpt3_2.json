As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",
            "output": "NEG",

I was shocked as I looked at this movie plenty of times and passed it up, until I read an article in Fangoria #244 article on Stuart Gordon, and decied to rent it. I would say the asking price is to high$15 is more reasonable. This movie does not get boring. The action is good, the plot is good, the acting is actually very good. this movie has already been broken down so no need for me to do so. Overall if you are looking for a good movie that will keep you awake and interested check out \"King of the Ants\", it is a good flick and doubt you will be dissapointed I know I was'nt",

After Romero's &quot;Dead--movies&quot; as well as &quot;Dead Alive&quot; and &quot;Bad Taste&quot; this movie is rotten.No real plot,and no characters with any depth.The director calls it art.This is another example of the depth horror movie making has fallen and many seem to think it's really good.We are told that there are 139 deaths, but some of them seem repeated ad infintum.Comic Books do better than this.I guess if you were stoned and only were interested in a mess you might find this interesting.The most revolting things in the movie were when one character vomits on another and balls up snot to throw in a woman's mouth.This mess cost too much money and was a complete waste of time.Italians seem to do better with crappy gore than Germans",

You really have to have a wacky side though, the same side you would use when you watch Anchorman or Harold and Kumar go to white castle. I understand some people not being able to get on this level of crazy stupidity to laugh at this but if you are this is definitely a movie you and your friends need to watch. There are a lot of hidden jokes you won't get until the second time you watch it like when the new owner left his Hummer parked outside and I just got a was spray painted in front of hummer sorry if you don't get it. Snowboarding buddies Rick (Jason London), Luke (Zach Galifianakis), Anthony (Flex Alexander) and Pig Pen (Derek Hamilton) are living like kings on Alaska's Bull Mountain. Partying hard, looking for girls, and doing just about anything to have a good time is what life on Bull Mountain is all about. But when town founder Papa Muntz dies, his son Ted (Willie Garson) decides to sell the mountain to a nasty Colorado ski mogul John Majors. Everyone is going crazy because they're losing their jobs and they can't afford to keep living where they are. By his plans to turn the boarding mountain into an espresso-and-tofu ski resort, and it's up to these idiots to save the mountain.",

I could not watch it when it became vulgar with offensive material.  It is too bad to have a good story with great actors lowering its potentially good quality with such degrading vulgarity. There are better ways of getting this aspect of the story across with such depiction.  Silly me, I should have checked the rating.  I \"assumed\" it safe as it would involve our beloved Roy Orbinson.  I was sadly and horridly disappointed and cannot in conscience recommend it to anyone at anytime.  By the way,I destroyed the tape in good conscience.  Watch at your own eternal risk",

WOW! ever since tenchi muyo was taken off the air, their has not been any anime shows that have interested me. for years i searched, never finding anything worth watching. then, i sort of gave up. i would occasionaly check adult swim for any signs of a new great anime but to no avail. then one night it happened: i saw the second episode of Samurai Champloo air on adult swim. at first, i wasnt paying attention to the words and action. i was looking at what had caught my eye when i was flipping channels: THE ANIMATION! the artwork was incredible!the colors that were used to draw the characters and the world they were interacting in made it seem real. it was almost as if it was a sitcom, with real people. only tis was completly animated. it was eye-popping!then, i started to watch the show itself and the show was great!!! anyway, since then i have been addicted to the series and i have six of the volumes. but alas, the last one (number seven) comes out this month on the 17th. the show is coming to an end. so anyway, im going to write reviews for each of the volumes and rate them. i rated volume one of samurai champloo below:    episode one: tempestuous temperaments- jin, mugen and fuu meet for the first time. mugen is looking for a challenge and hears about three \"bad asses\" and sends some cowards to go get them. mugen however, does not know that jin has killed them already. mugen mistakes jin as one of the \"bad asses\" and attatcks him. a brilliant fight insues, and jin mugen and fuu end up travling together.   i rate episode one a 10/10    episode two: redeye reprisal-  mugen cut a mans arm off in episode one. in this episode, the man is out for revenge. the man recruits an ogre by the name of oniwaka to help him exact revenge on mugen. also, jin encounters a highly skilled assasin who has been hired to kill him. another great fight. and last of all, our modest (cough) fuu gets smashed.  i rate this episode 9/10    episodes 3 & 4: hellhounds for hire part one and two- the three heros part ways but fate eventually brings them back together. jin is hired by a gang as a bodygaurd. mugen is hired as a bodyguard by a rival gang. fuu is tricked into capture and is forced to work in a broffel house.  i give both episodes 3&4 10/10    thats the end of my review for volume one of samurai champloo.  if you are new to the series check out my reviews for each volume to see if you want to get the volumes. i will say this, they are really expensive. but they are worth the money. i get them at best buy and they are 24.99 plus tax and each volume has four episodes on it. if you have not bought this dvd and are debating weither it is good or not, i reccomend you buy it. i can personally vouch for this dvd. of course, its always good to check other reviews by different people as well.   later.  i hope this review helped",
