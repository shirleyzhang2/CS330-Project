We can accept that some houses will be torn down and replaced with apartments in the name of density, but too often these numbers are used to justify wasteful and short-sighted building practices.  For instance, in the case of the Eastmoreland sequoia lots (a story I imagine developers and sympathizers of this article scoffed at), the neighborhood offered a very viable plan to build two smaller houses on the property without clearcutting the land, along with compensation for preserving the trees.  Such houses would have been more affordable, and saved a valuable public resource: big trees.  This option was rejected because the developer didn't have kit houses of the right size and shape available.  A little creativity, common sense, and smarts could solve both the issue of density and destruction of the things we like about PDX.",
