            "input": "people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies .\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno - thriller .\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked .\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic .\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman .\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits .\nbut the right stuff film is n't even fiction .\nit was based on the non - fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program .\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes .\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier .\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado .\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records .\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age .\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space .\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all - american image .\nin one of critics ' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman 's film looks quite atypical for its time .\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies .\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk - taking \" artsy \" projects .\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .\nthe plot is almost non - existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts .\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece .\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles .\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero\nwhose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty .\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases .\nshepard 's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean - cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots ' wives .\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice - president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch .\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman 's superb direction .\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline .\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .\nin that setting , it 's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights .\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots .\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity - seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity .\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman 's superb use of poetic movie language .\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) .\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights .\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space .\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement\nevery time i hear it .\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy .\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period .\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws .\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts are n't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) .\nfilm also lacks proper closure .\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long .\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan 's america .\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s .\ntime has passed ; now we do n't see astronauts as heroes .\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers .\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up .\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts ' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky .\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .",

            "input": "some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese 's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the ' 80s . since there are still a number of ' 80s films that i have n't seen , i do n't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i 'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level .\nbio - pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account .\nit 's rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining .\nraging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre .\nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the ' 40s and ' 50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen .\nfor all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying .\nhistorically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion 's share of the details culled from la motta 's own autobiography ( which was co - written with joseph carter and peter savage ) .\nhowever , although la motta is credited as the movie 's \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout .\nthe la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ?\nparanoia , jealousy , and blind rage .\nsex and violence are inextricably linked .\nthe title is apt ?\nla motta is a raging bull .\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them .\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled .\nthe two people who spar with him on life 's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother / manager , joey ( joe pesci ) .\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses .\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence .\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up - and - coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class .\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch - rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match .\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife .\nvicki becomes jake 's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain .\nhis own insecurity is so great that he can not accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him .\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ?\nperhaps even his brother .\n( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f\n* * king my wife ? ? ?\n\" ) in the late ' 40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall .\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing .\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray .\nby the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ?\na broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine .\nraging bull is the other side of rocky .\nsylvester stallone 's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 .\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production .\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring .\nwhile scorsese 's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working .\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased .\nthere 's little i can say here that has n't already said about de niro 's performance .\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding .\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering .\nand , although there 's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro 's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him .\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting .\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit .\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form .\nhow many actors would go that far ?\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance .\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) .\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses\nde niro 's .\npesci , who has basically re - created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino )\n, presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother .\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed .\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it 's startling to behold .\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ?\nthe only kind of woman who would ensnare jake .\nlater , she 's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear .\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black - and - white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) .\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black - and - white approach is almost unheard of .\n( one important recent exception , schindler 's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . )\nin black - and - white ( especially considering scorsese 's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing .\nthere 's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas .\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point - of - view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta 's perspective .\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta 's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown .\nafter that , his career was all downhill .\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta 's future .\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese is n't as interested in boxing as he is in the character .\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies .\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self .\nwho can not feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando 's speech from on the waterfront ?\n( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" )\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the ' 80s .\nand , if not , it 's certainly perilously close to the zenith .",
