    "Definition": [
        "Given an object and a part, you need to decide if the object has that part as one of its components or not. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its parts. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?'. The answer should be 1 or 0, where 1 means the object has the given part, and 0 means the object doesn't have the part."
