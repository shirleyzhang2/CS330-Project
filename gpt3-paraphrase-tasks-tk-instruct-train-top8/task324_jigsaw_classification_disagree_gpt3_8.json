        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: 'disagree' or 'agree'. If the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, classify it as 'disagree'. This disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as 'agree' only if it does not fall into the 'disagree' category."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The topic of climate change conspiracy is controversial. This comment expresses the user's disbelief of climate change, which is against the general consensus. Thus, this comment is likely to raise public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: I find it almost comical that some people are actually tying to convince the Residents that taking half of the PFD is being done in an effort to SAVE the PFD. The fact of the matter is that the very same Republican led Government that squandered our oil revenue, and placed the state in this position, did so fully intending to try and get their greedy hands on the PFD. There has been no real effort to correct the give away of Alaska's money to non-producing oil companies. This gave them what they have been looking for for years, a way to get at the PFD. Demand side economics says that the more disposable income that each individual household has , the healthier the overall economy will be. Pushing the supply side agenda simply moves the money to the top so it can \"trickle down \". It is a scam plain and simple. The only accomplishment will be the theft, once again, of millions of dollars from state residents. Greed motivates this sham of a state Government, and not the economy.",
