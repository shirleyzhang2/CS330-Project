    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. self-need is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation, such as by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages. Output Yes if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output No."

'Yes, it would.' 'I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?'\nUtterance: 'You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.'",

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
