            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

You are implying that it is YOU who determines what is or is not authentic - and since you have determined that his music does NOT speak to something authentic, you are offended that those people who DO think it speaks to something authentic exist at all. \n\nIt's very confusing to try to sort through, because it requires two wildly irrational assumptions. First is that Springsteen's heart, mind, and soul have been irrevocably damaged by the acquisition of money to the point he can not empathize with the very class of people he spent his entire life surrounded by, and is no longer capable of sincerity about those issues and experiences. The second is that somehow YOU have a sense of what is and is not authentic which surpasses both his AND his fans, who despite your claims, come from all walks of life, all over the globe.",
