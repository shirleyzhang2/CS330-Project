Those code words told many the police are the bad guys and deserve no respect.  I'm not saying he was the cause for this incident , just that he , as our leader , as set the tone that cops are bad , liars, bullies and killers----rather that telling the nation to respect authority . Over and over again he has painted police in a bad light. He sides with the thugs first and doesn't give police the credit and praise they deserve for keeping us all safe---regardless of our color or station in life.",
