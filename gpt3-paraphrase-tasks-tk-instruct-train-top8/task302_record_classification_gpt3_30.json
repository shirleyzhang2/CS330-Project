It was also the sight of observers in wheelchairs lining the middle rows of the Georgia World Congress Center auditorium that moved the crowd to rise from their seats again and again. The Rotarians, wearing glowing LED bracelets, came to Atlanta to commit once again to the elusive goal they first outlined in 1985: a world free of polio, the highly infectious disease that invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours. The disease can be prevented by a safe vaccine, which can protect a child for life when given multiple times.In 1985, polio paralyzed more than 350,000 children in 125 countries every yearLast year, just 40 cases were reported worldwide \n Questions:Though he praised the _' hard-won achievements, he also addressed the hard question on the minds of most attendees.
