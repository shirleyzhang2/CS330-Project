        "Given an object and a part, you need to output 1 or 0 based on whether the object has the given part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', and you know that a gun has a barrel, you should output 1. If you are asked 'gun has barrel', and you know that a gun does not have a barrel, you should output 0. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?"
