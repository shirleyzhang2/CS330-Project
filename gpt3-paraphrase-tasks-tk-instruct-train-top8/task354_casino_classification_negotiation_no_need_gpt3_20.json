    "Definition": [
        "You are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, and 'No' if it does not. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item. It can directly benefit the opponent by implying that the item is up for grabs."
