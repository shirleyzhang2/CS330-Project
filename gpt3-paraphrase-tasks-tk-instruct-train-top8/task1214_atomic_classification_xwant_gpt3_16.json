    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonX, respectively. For example, if as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonX also desires to hug PersonY, then the answer would be classified as \"Yes\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
