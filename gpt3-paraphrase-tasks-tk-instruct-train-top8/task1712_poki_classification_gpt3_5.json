        "You are given a short poem which is written by a kid. Based on the poem, you must predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from grade 1st to 6th-grade will be considered as in elementary school, and 7th to 12th-grade kids will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs, i.e., elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output and it cannot have both categories at a time."
