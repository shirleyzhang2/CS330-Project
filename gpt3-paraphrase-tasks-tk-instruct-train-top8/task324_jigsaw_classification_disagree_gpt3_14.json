            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

Trudeau is wasting $30 billion a year on higher government expenses and he's attacking small businesses in a cynical political ploy that would bring in $250 million. Trudeau's original tax the rich/cut middle class taxes resulted in a $1.8 billion hole in the treasury so similar results could be expected from the new plan. Meanwhile Trudeau dithers while Canada's oil and gas sectors are under assault by foreign-backed career activist parasites all the while Quebec's CO2 emitters get government subsidies (Bombardier and Quebec's new concrete plant with direct ties to Bombardier family). There are 40,000 illegal migrants in Canada that wait an average 16 months for a hearing - the welfare alone costs taxpayers $300 million/year and Trudeau does nothing, just like the Liberals do nothing about the growing industry of birth tourism for passports...",
