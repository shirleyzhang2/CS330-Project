        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used to call out fairness for personal benefit. This can be done through an explicit call out or can be implied."
