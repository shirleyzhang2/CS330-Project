I loved the atmosphere (very classy)  and the martinis (very unique and tasty). We dropped serious money on the drinks. We had a coupon from Foursquare for a free appetizer. I ordered the truffle fries, very delicious. I would recommend coming here for a cocktail or two, but if you're looking to put away some drinks, you could get more for your buck somewhere else. Then come here :)",

He then added to that by insulting me and making comments that my luxury vehicle looks like trash. He would not pay for the interior damage. He did not care about customer service at all.

We were told that we could choose wherever we'd like to dine which I liked. I loved our server. We pretty much let her call the shots and I loved how into it she got haha. She was spot on with her recommendations. I loved my cocktail, which for me is a great way to begin a meal. We started with the french fries (YUM), and I ordered the lasagna with the meatballs I had heard so much about. YUM again. Great service, great food, sold. I will definitely be back.",

            "input": "Very impressive so far. The style is very similar to the much-larger Cosmopolitan, but there is an emphasis on customer service that is noticeable. Little touches like a bellman to walk you to your room and point out amenities, complimentary full breakfast (with omelet station) every morning, and staff that great you at every opportunity. Some of these might be just for the opening this weekend, but there is almost nothing that resembles the previous property (i.e. Bill's Gambling Hall and Saloon).\\n\\nPROS\\n- Modern decor and furniture\\n- Complimentary full breakfast with omelet station\\n- Drai's on the rooftop adds a nightclub and dayclub to entertainment options\\n\\nCONS\\n- Difficult to access via car - the driveway is on Flamingo (which has horrendous traffic) and is easy to miss\\n- Not everything is open just yet - Giada's is scheduled to open 03-JUN\\n\\nTIP\\nIf driving, try to avoid Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip) and approach from Koval (to the east of the Strip).",

I'll admit the only reason i come to here is because of the service and that rosemary potato chicken pizza (I rarely support corporate, I'm too hipster lol) . My partner had the pasta which i was questionable on however it was great and spicy. Our server was so sweet and very helpful. She walked by with this cheese crisp guacamole plate for another table with I hated her for due to I wanted to order it too. Food does take some time but this place is a small establishment.

The Dailey Method helped firm my rear, but not before it kicked it up and down that instruction room. Big thanks to Gabi K to dragging me out to my first ever DM class.\\n\\nAn equal mix of cardio, resistance, yoga and Pilates, I've never felt like this immediately after a class: arms felt heavy, limbs stretched, and back loose as a goose. \\n\\nLet me say that this particular class was not easy--nor was standing in the front right next to the instructor (no way I could sneak in a two-second break). It takes a decent amount of coordination and listening skills, but even if that doesn't top your resume, don't be deterred from at least trying TDM.\\n\\nWomen of all shapes, sizes, flexibility and strength were in this class, and as the instructor said, you may not be able to touch your toes on the dance bar, but you'll eventually get there. \\n\\nIt's a non-stop workout, and though you may be cursing your instructor as you hold a V-up for a few seconds, in the end you'll have a huge grin on your sweaty face knowing you just did a wonderful thing for your body. Great music, a spunky instructor and a few good laughs make it an entertaining class as well. \\n\\nAn individual class for first timers is $20, which is steep if you anticipate on continuing on a few times a week; so I suggest the new client unlimited special for $100 ($200 for returning clients).\\n\\nWear yoga pants and somewhat form-fitting clothing so that instructors can see if your poses are correct. (Loose shorts aren't recommended. Your legs will be stretched up over a ballet bar, in the air and all over the place--with mirrors.) And socks are required (you may want to spring for those fancy socks with grippers at the bottom so you don't slide around), so don't forget! This location has a clean locker room, showers, and even a small children's area for the rugrats. Oh, and the spunky owner Linda's little dog is absolutely adorable! \\n\\nHoping TDM opens up a location in Houston soon, til then, I'll have to wait. Luckily, I'm in SF (home to TDM) for the week and am taking as many classes as my schedule and budgie allow.",
