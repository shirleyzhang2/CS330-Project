        "You will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on the context. Your task is to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by taking extracts from the context and concatenating them into a summary. Abstractive questions require you to paraphrase the context using new sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, typically yes or no."

These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5.

This model uses the cluster words from the induced word sense inventory as sparse features that represent the sense.\n\nWord senses based on context word features. This representation is based on a sum of word vectors of all cluster words in the induced sense inventory weighted by distributional similarity scores.\n\nSuper senses based on cluster word features. To build this model, induced word senses are first globally clustered using the Chinese Whispers graph clustering algorithm BIBREF9 . The edges in this sense graph are established by disambiguation of the related words BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . The resulting clusters represent semantic classes grouping words sharing a common hypernym, e.g. \u201canimal\u201d. This set of semantic classes is used as an automatically learned inventory of super senses: There is only one global sense inventory shared among all words in contrast to the two previous traditional \u201cper word\u201d models. Each semantic class is labeled with hypernyms. This model uses words belonging to the semantic class as features.\n\nSuper senses based on context word features. This model relies on the same semantic classes as the previous one but, instead, sense representations are obtained by averaging vectors of words sharing the same class. \n Question: Do they use a neural model for their task?",

In our experiments, we observe that comparable numbers of labeled features for each class have to be supplied. We randomly select $t \\in [1, 20]$ features from the feature pool for one class, and only one feature for the other. Our methods are also evaluated on datasets with different unbalanced class distributions. We manually construct several movie datasets with class distributions of 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 by randomly removing 50%, 67%, 75% positive documents. Incorporating KL divergence is robust enough to control unbalance both in the dataset and in labeled features while the other three methods are not so competitive. \n Question: How do they define robustness of a model?",

Considering the features contour plot, Rehman et al. BIBREF5 suggested that all those features which exist in top left, and bottom right corners of the contour are extremely significant as compared to those features which exist around diagonals. State-of-the-art filter based feature selection algorithms such as ACC2 treat all those features in the same fashion which exist around the diagonals BIBREF5. \n Question: Is the filter based feature selection (FSE) a form of regularization?",
