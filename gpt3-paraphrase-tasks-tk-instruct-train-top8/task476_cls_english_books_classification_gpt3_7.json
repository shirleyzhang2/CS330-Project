            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

Penelope Fitzgerald is at her most devilishly entrancing in this tale revolving around the London acting school run (and I mean RUN!) by Freddie, a larger-than-life Gorgon whose will cannot be resisted. Fitzgerald has fun skewering the backstage pretentions, intrigue and petty jealousies of the London theater world of the early 1960s, but, clearly loving every seedy corner of it, she celebrates it with such gusto that you want to sign up on the spot for a season or two. That combination of wryness and fondness makes this short novel among Fitzgerald's most satisfying. And when Freddie goes out looking for a pound or two, hang on to your wallets",

I'd seen the movie \"Valley of the Dolls,\" whose characters are pictured on the cover of this book, but only recently did I read Jacqueline Susann's magnum opus.  What a pleasant surprise! This engaging novel, despite its length, is a fast read.  It is better -- far better -- than the film. (The movie, however, is a \"must see\" for its over-the-top acting, 60's fashions and \"so bad it's good\" storyline.)      Although initially billed (to great effect) as a steamy romance novel, the book is much more substantive.  Each of the characters is well-developed, and each has human flaws that lead to her success or spell her undoing.  Before it was fashionable, Susann used the character of Anne Welles to explore one woman's attempt to ignore the pressures to marry early and instead devote herself to a career.  Susann examined the problem of the abuse of legal drugs at a time when it was seen as primarily a teenage phenomenon.  Neely O'Hara is initially a sympathetic character, but has enough of the \"bitter greens\" (envy, jealousy and bile) which, when added to an insatiable ego and a large quantity of pills, leads to  her rise and fall.  And Jennifer North knows what she has and knows its advantages -- and limitations.  These characters are real, and one need not be in show business to know them.    Although written in 1966 (with a story that begins in 1945), the plotline is not dated.  Neither is the message: Susann asks whether having everything you ever wanted really is the key to happiness.  There is a reason why this book has remained a bestseller and continues to enthrall a new generation of readers.",

This is a fascinating, entertaining, short read about a group of travellers who take a bus excursion from hell into a place where they are given a chance to go into heaven. Surprisingly, they actually seem to prefer hell.  This is not a book about what heaven is like or what hell is like.  It's about people like us, and our choices, and how they affect our lives as eternal beings.    Reading the dialogue as heavenly beings try to convince them to come to heaven, I found myself trying to keep track of who was the \"right\" person and who was \"wrong\", because the way the hell-people were talking was just the same way I talk! Of course, they seemed so stupid to me because I was on the heaven side of the book. But it reminded me of a quote from the movie The Truman Show (paraphrased): \"I think what bothers you is that Truman prefers his cell.\"     These people lived in hell (and that description is interesting too) and they would rather go back there than swallow the pride that had made them reject God in the first place. One of Lewis' easier reads, for people who find him difficult to follow",

This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it.  Well, I didn't love it.  While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature.  There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers.  I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all.  It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author.",
