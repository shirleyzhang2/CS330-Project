Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called \"Perfect Gentleman\" with 2 titles on it: \"Ooh la la\" and \"One more Chance\". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.",

Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic.",

ViewSonic would not replace the first monitor- fair enough as it was out of warrantee. I purchased a replacement. When it came, the screen was blue, and the color could not be adjusted. ViewSonic sent a replacement which had a green screen, and again, the color could not be adjusted. They were unable to find another VA912b, so they sent a different model to replace it.-Meanwhile, my second monitor, again a VA912b burned out the backlight after less than six months of use.-Beware that the glowing reviews you see for this monitor may not take into account its poor reliability. Should you choose this monitor, be sure to get an extended warrantee! Better yet, do yourself a favor and choose another model or manufacturer.",

Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary.

Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's.",
