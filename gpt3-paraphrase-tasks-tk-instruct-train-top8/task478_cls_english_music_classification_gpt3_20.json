            "input": "boring.... . my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

            "input": "No Blood, No Sugar, No Sex, No Magik! . I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.     Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast",

Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not",

It has too much uninspired music from Browne's later albums, and leaves out classics like \"That Girl Could Sing.\"  Sadly, there are no decent collections of Jackson Browne's music yet released, and fans will still have to get all of his great albums separately and make their own collections.      From other reviews, I gather that rock snobs are frustrated by the album's omission of \"obscure gems.\"  And people like me who just want to hear the great songs we grew up with are equally disappointed.",

            "input": "A Memory . In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the \"Jamming With Edward\" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)     Ry said the Stones \"stole\" his sound and riffs. He said \"Honky Tonk Woman\" was an example of this \"ripoff.\" In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.    Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called \"devil\" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered \"satanic.\"    Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.     I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company.",

You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.      Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his \"fans\" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as \"music\".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway.",
