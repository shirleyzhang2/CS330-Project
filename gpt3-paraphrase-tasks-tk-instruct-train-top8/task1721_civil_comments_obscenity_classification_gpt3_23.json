You sir, are arrogant, devoid of principles, corrupted by greed, shameless, and nothing more than a paid shill for your employer Conoco. Your employer is part of a cabal to steal Alaska's resources and get hit men  like you to vote to  pay for the theft from the state's treasury on the backs of good Alaskans including children, widows and seniors. It is time for you and your accomplices to go, whether by indictment, failure at reelection, or recall. You insult the intelligence of the readers of this newspaper by trying to pass blame on the few honest legislators standing in the way of the cabal.  The rape of Alaska is nearly a done deal, thanks to you and your ilk, Senator.
