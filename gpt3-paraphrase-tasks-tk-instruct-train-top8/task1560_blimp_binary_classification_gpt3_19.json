        "In this task, you will see an English sentence. You need to tell if the sentence is a good representation of an anaphor number agreement or a bad representation. An anaphor is an expression that can only be understood by looking at another expression. Anaphor number agreement is when a phrase agrees with the expression before it: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. In this task, a good representation of an anaphor number agreement should be called 'good', while everything else should be called 'bad'. A good representation of an anaphor number agreement is a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match in plurality. A bad representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match."
