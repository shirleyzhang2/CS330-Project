    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, and output 'No' if it does not. The elicit-pref strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."
