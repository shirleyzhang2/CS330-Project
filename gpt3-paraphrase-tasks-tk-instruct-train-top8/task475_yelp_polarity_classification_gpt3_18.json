            "input": "When I first saw that the Jade Grille was opening in my home town, I have to say I was a little skeptical.  I thought that by the look of the front and the font of the sign that this was a lower class general asian cuisine restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised!\\n\\nI went in on a Sunday evening and was lucky enough to notice the buy one skewer or sushi roll get one half off promotion.  I believe it goes from 4 or 4:30 to 6:30ish but I could be mistaken.  My mother and I decided to try it.\\n\\nThe inside was lovely and clean and the hostess and bartender (as we sat at the bar for the promotion) were both very friendly.  \\n\\nWe ordered two soups, two skewers, and two sushi rolls.  My mother thoroughly enjoyed the Seafood Hot & Sour soup and I ordered the Crab Asparagus soup which was delightful.  Often you find with crab or lobster soups that you can hardly taste the meat or that there's very little meat to begin with but this was not the case in my experience.  It was hot and had a perfect amount of sliced asparagus and crab meat and both flavors were very prevalent.\\n\\nThe skewers we ordered were the bacon covered quail eggs and the fish with miso and kabakayi sauce.  The fish was good and we finished the piece very quickly but quail eggs are my personal favorite.  I would recommend these soft boiled bacon wrapped balls of heaven to anyone!\\n\\nI believe the two sushi rolls we ordered were the Crazy Gaga Roll and the Jade Roll though I could be wrong as they don't have descriptions on the website.  They were both good; one was wrapped with a thin crepe ad the other was topped with jalape\\u00f1o slices.  The jalape\\u00f1o one had fish and avocado on top and, although it was very tasty, the avocado had turned brown already and wasn't as appealing to look at.\\n\\nWithout drinks and with what we ordered, our total came to about $50 before the promotion was added which got us to about $35 after tax.  So while it was tasty and the atmosphere was nice, it was still a bit pricey.  I certainly won't be buying drinks with my meals at least.  But overall I was well fed and very happy with my first experience with the Jade Grille.",

            "input": "What a great little place!  The fresh baked break and sandwiches made with meat sliced to order are just perfect.  The sandwiches are really big and reasonably priced for the size, easily enough for 2 people to share, especially if you save room for dessert, which you definitely should do.  There is a lovely dessert case with lots of pretty things inside.  So far I have tried 5 different pastries, and all have been really good.  Not the best desserts I have ever had, but definitely very tasty. The only drawback is very slow service.  There was only one man working up front the day we tried lunch, and he was making all of the sandwiches himself.  Since everything is made to order, this is not the place to go if you are in a rush, but if you have the time it is worth the wait.",

If you time it right you can see the volcano erupting. \\n\\nCame on a Thursday night with 3 other girls, didn't pay cover since a promoter found us that day at our pool and invited us. Received a couple of free drinks too from him. Drinks are the usual, $13 average for a vodka drink. Dancing was a lot of fun but like everyone says it gets so crowded so you wont have much space of your own. I was drunk so I didn't care much. \\n\\nI never had a wait for the bathrooms upstairs with the crazy doors but you know I could have just skipped the line for all I know, a lot of people stand up there to watch the scene below. \\n\\nI hope to go back on my next trip.",

            "input": "This was my first time attending the festival.  While there were many good craft beers to try, maneuvering the festival was down right miserable.  Festival management has room to improve for next year.\\n\\nParking was a total cluster.  Seemed as though they only made sure enough space existed for the expected participation level, but forgot to think about the efficiency of traffic flow.  The walk to the festival entrance from the parking was a road trip and a half without the use of your car.\\n\\nLine efficiency was non-existant.  Most breweries offered 2-4 options and were not efficient at delivering.  Often many beer servers/pourers had to toggle back and forth/change places in order to serve the requested brew.  Lines were on average 30-40 people long.  So, you grabbed a pour and went to stand in the next line of interest.  Not the relaxing and fun experience that I was looking forward to.  \\n\\nThey offer a single small plastic tasting cup.  In every other tasting event I've attended there were rinsing stations with water and/or napkins.  Without the ability to taste each beer without remnants of the previous, it becomes difficult to evaluate theeach unique flavor profile.\\n\\nIt was very hot and icky, and there was an extreme shortage of shade or shelter.  The bathroom sitch was strictly gross port-o-potties.    \\n\\nI want to love this local event more, but there were too many variables overlooked that put the customer in the 'zone of pain'.  Now if this event were cheap of free I would have overlooked the shortcomings, but is in fact neither.",
