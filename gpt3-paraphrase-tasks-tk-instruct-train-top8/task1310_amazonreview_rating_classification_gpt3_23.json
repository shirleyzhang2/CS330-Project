I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

However, it gets only 3 star for the very cheaply made screen protector which keeps getting finger smudges and not very sensitive to touch. It doesn't even feel like tempered glass but looks and feels more like plastic made. I would invest in separate glass protector. My husband had to remove his to make the touch screen work! Would rather some few more bucks and get a better one.",

I bought these for when I ride my motorcycle and they wok GREAT! They provide very nice ambiant isolation and at mid volume I can still hear them clearly at highway speed. They have a particularly clear treble and for earbuds also have as much base as you would reasonably want. I will definitely buy these again or replace whatever modules I manage to break. I could only give a higher score if they were made of a metal and not a hard plastic.",

The product is not FDA APPROVED. Literally says it right on the bottle. Amazon is going to get sued eventually for allowing such sellers to sell products such as this. I\u2019m not even sure if the product inside the capsule is Vitamin C, it feels and taste like plastic. (I opened the capsule and tried to mix it in my water, but the little beads inside do not even dissolve, like I said MOST LIKELY PLASTIC)!!!!!!!",
