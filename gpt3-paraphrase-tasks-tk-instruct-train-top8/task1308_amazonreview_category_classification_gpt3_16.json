I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

I go to the gym 4-5 times a week, start with a mile on the elliptical and then an hour of weights using these headphones and they've worked great. When the battery is running low I might get a quick static feedback like the range is too far from my shorts pocket to the headphones on my ear but it's extremely brief. Sound quality and noise isolation is great, with the volume up I can't hear the generic workout radio they have on or much of the weights clinking together. Overall great headphones and would recommend. \n Category: electronics",

The rest of the items are of little importance to me because I expect them to be cheap. I was going to cancel, but was suckered by the prospect of the next box. I was expecting a cool pop considering it was for Marvel's First Ten Years edition. I can't think of a lamer pop idea. I can't imagine anyone that wants an Iron Man 2 fight scene between him and Whiplash. Truly terrible. Did I say lame already? Just pure nonsense. Now that next box looks like a retro x-men box so once again I'm lured in. Like many others, I'm going to give the collectors corp one more go before canceling. However, if I get something as stupid as the Whiplash pop I'm done. \n Category: toy",
