I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I didn't read the description and implicit warnings against removing the screen without being familiar with the procedure. I turned a $20 repair into a $200 repair because I tried to duplicate a display/touch screen repair off of YouTube, which apparently is a different, process than replacing just the glass and will wreck your display. I really wish it worked out for me and I could give 5 stars, but I didn't really get to use it. I'll give the seller some credit anyway.",

The space between the case cover and phone was to great so it sounded like typing on a plastic film. I could have dealt with that but after a few weeks the control knob on the side of the case broke off while I was turning off my ringer? I had only used it half and dozen times and it broke. As far as the waterproof feature, it seemed to handle that well. I didn\u2019t fully submerged the phone in water, but the spills from cooking and children held up.",

It was also bigger than it looked in the photos. It covered the entire back of my head, which again made me realize that I needed a lot of hair to attach it to.",
