        "In this task, you will be given a conversation and a question. You should categorize the question into one of the following groups: matching, summary, logic, arithmetic, or commonsense. Matching questions are those that are entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in the dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. Summary questions require the whole picture of the dialogue, such as the topic of the dialogue and the relation between the speakers. Logical questions require logical reasoning to answer. Arithmetic questions require arithmetic knowledge to answer. Commonsense questions require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group."

M: When we think of energy or fuel for our homes and cars, we think of petroleum, a fossil fuel processed from oil removed from the ground, of which there is a limited supply. But alternative fuels can be many things. Wind, sun and water can all be used to create fuel. W: Is the threat of running out of petroleum real? M: It has taken thousands of years to create the natural stores of petroleum we have available at a much faster rate than it is being produced over time. The real controversy surrounding the amount of petroleum we have is how much we need to keep in reserve for future use. Most experts agree that by around 2025, the amount of petroleum we use will reach a peak. Then production and availability will begin to seriously decline. This is not to say there will be no petroleum at this point. But it'll become very difficult and therefore expensive to extract. W: Is that the most important reason to develop alternative fuel and energy sources? M: There are two very clear reasons to do so. One is that whether we have 60 or 600 years of fossil fuels left, we have to find other fuel sources eventually. So the sooner we start, the better off we will be. The other big argument is that when long time, which leads to some long-term negative effects, like global warming and the greenhouse effect., Question: What do we usually refer to when we talk about energy according to the man?

You know, I tried on about twenty at the shop, and this one isn't really what I wanted. I especially can't stand the high neck. W: Why did you buy it then? M: The salesman sold it to me before I realized what had happened. He just never stopped talking about the latest fashions and special reduced prices. Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up and I realized that I'd paid him. W: Well, it doesn't look too bad. I think it looks good on you. M: But I went out to get a blue sweater to match my black trousers-something with a V-neck, short sleeves and pattern-and I came home with a brown sweater with a high neck, long sleeves and no pattern. W: You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen. They will sell you all sorts of things you don't want if you don't watch out. M: Next time I'll send my wife. She would probably sell something to the salesman. W: That's a good idea. Actually women are much better at shopping than men. Whenever my husband and I buy something important, I always have the finalsay. M: I must admit that women are better at shopping. I should simply leave the whole business to them., Question: Why did the man buy a sweater that he doesn't like?

No, honestly, I'll miss and worry about you, and you've really tried to prepare yourself. You know, I'm proud of you for that. You know, getting a university degree is a real accomplishment.

[Yeap.] Because, you know, if you don't, you'll lose your class schedule, and you have to register all over again. Daughter: Yeah, I paid for that a few days ago.

Not that old stuff. Mom! Father: Okay, okay. And you know you should set up an appointment to meet with your academic advisor to help you select future classes, right?

Father: And future possibilities ... a great salary, opportunities to make a difference in the community, and [Dad. I changed my major.] supporting ... Father: What? You changed you major ... you switched majors!? Daughter: Yeah. I really thought about it. After talking it over with Mom, I've decided to major in wildlife science. Father: What? What are you talking about? Daughter: Yeah. I want to degree in wildlife science. You know, analyzing, maintaining, and conserving national forests and wildlife. Father: What? Uh, uhh ...

I'm playing a consultancy role, really. I've only been here in China a month, but I'm already on very good terms with my colleagues in the Department of Computer Science. Well, I'm happy that you could come. Do sit down, please. W: Dr. Francis, do you know I've got a chance to go to Cambridge in August? I wonder if you could tell me something about Britain. M: Certainly. Well, I was actually brought up in Scotland. Enn, in fact, I've never been to Cambridge. But well,.., yes, I'm sure I can give you some useful tips. Now, what do you want to know, Li Ming? W: Things like weather. What's the usual temperature there? M: Mmm, the temperature in Scotland is 22, or 23 degrees Centigrade, on average, I think. But Cambridge would be warmer, around 25, I would guess, because it's down south. W: Oh, that's nice. Do you know it is 34 here? Last year it reached 39. By the way, where do you think I should stay? M: Oh, that's important. You can, err,.., I suppose, stay in the college-owned flats, which are often near where you have your classes, and some are even on the campus. That would certainly be convenient. W: Yes, it would. M: But it can also be a disadvantage because you are, in a sense, separated from ordinary society. You're a language teacher, and I think learning from society is a valuable experience. W: Yes, yes, exactly, so what's the alternative? M: Maybe finding an English host family. I know of a student Ali from the Middle East. He told me that he had learnt a lot by staying with a British family. W: Thank you, I think it's quite a good suggestion.
