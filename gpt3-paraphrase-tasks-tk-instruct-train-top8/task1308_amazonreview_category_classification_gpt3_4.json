I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",

I will say, they looked great in the pictures and early in the night were admired by many at the wedding. The Bad: The material is cheap, as others have said. I am 6'1\" about 230lbs (Not a small guy) and after adjusting these to fit me there was about 6-7 inches of excess in the front, I ended up trimming it off. The biggest drawback was a few hours into the reception I had people coming up to me and asking about my shirt. The suspenders turned the white shirt I was wearing brown. The color bled onto my shirt and destroying a brand new white shirt. I am afraid to use them again for fear of ruining any more shirts. Conclusion: Great for photos, but take them off before you dance or sweat... especially if you like the shirt you are wearing. \n Category: other",

The company was nice enough to send a full set of replacements after I had problems with leaky ink. However, after using the replacement inks, I had the same problem with inks leaking inside the printer while printing, creating streaks on the left edge of the printouts. Recently, I opened a new cartridge package, (which has been sitting undisturbed on a shelf) to find ink loose all over the bag. This is disappointing and inconvenient, as I was hoping there was a cheaper alternative to HP inks. Also, when I do print an image, it is very poor quality with streaks, etc. I\u2019m attaching some pictures, of the streaks on the left side of the page, the leaky cartridge which I just opened, and a printout of an image, which is printing with lots of streaks. I tried to message the company directly, but can't seem to find a way to contact them. \n Category: apparel",

Nothing 'wrong' with it so to speak, but I got this as an alarm security for my room as our house got broken into back in October. The reason I got this is so it would warn me when someone was in my room and/or record images of the individual. After about 4 or 5 firmware updates (so it was current on firmware) I discovered that the alarm takes a still picture but it was never of me moving, so no picture of someone who would walk in. Also, the alerts came 10 minutes after the motion was detected. It works ok as a live image, and you can record images as long as you are actively on the app, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a live alarm/alert. Moving on, the website and downloads for pc software wouldn't even let me install, and consistently used broken English while trying to download and in it's error messages. \n Category: camera",
