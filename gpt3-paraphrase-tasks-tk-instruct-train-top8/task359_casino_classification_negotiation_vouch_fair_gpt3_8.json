        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be done through an explicit call out or can be implied."
