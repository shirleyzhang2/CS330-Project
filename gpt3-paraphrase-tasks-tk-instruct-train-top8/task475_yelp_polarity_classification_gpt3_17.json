Thoroughly and utterly whelming..\\n\\nLet me start by saying the only truly aggravating thing was that they were out of 2 different kinds of red wine and there were maybe 4 glass choices to begin with. After the next one wasn't available by the glass I just kind of gave up and let my husband pick. \\n\\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, Garlic Mash and Broccoli. I had the Bacon Blue Butter Ribeye, Loaded Baked Potato and Caesar Salad. We split the Crispy Garlic-Pepper Zucchini things and White Chocolate Cheesecake. At the risk of being redundant, if I don't specify something it was adequate. \\n\\nThe Prime Rib 12 oz. had no crust on it. Zero. So it was basically a hunk o' roasted meat. The Garlic Mashed was not garlicky and texture was way off.\\n\\nThe Ribeye was thin. Like IHOP steak thin. \\n\\nThe two stars is mostly because the price implies that something will be really good. And nothing was. For $100 (our meal plus tip) you get better quality, service and value at Outback, Yard House, etc. \\n\\nThanks Black Angus! I now know what it is to be whelmed.",

Since I requested hot stone massage ( an hour and half)  and hot towel foot also peppermint head massage which was an extra 10 dollars and upgraded the hot towel foot and hot stone which costed an extra 20 dollars each.  I paid for the bill just minutes before they were done with my wife's massage and after leaving I asked if they did the peppermint massage, *nope* they only spent 5 minutes on her foot. Even I tipped them 25 dollars. Guess they got a much larger tip when they didn't follow through with the upgrades and peppermint head massage. Much regret for that visit.",

            "input": "Met up with a bunch of our friends for our \\\"\"Getting The Hell Out Of Arizona Forever\\\"\" farewell shindig. They were really accommodating about us not being sure how many would show up. We had to add extra tables, and all had separate checks, and they were totally cool with it. \\n\\nThe good? The BEER! I mean, come on people- it's freaking Nimbus. I don't think they've ever made a *bad* beer. And surprisingly, it's not as expensive to get a pint here as it is to get it in the store. \\n\\nThe bad? Just like all of Arizona (cultural wasteland that it is), they don't understand what veganism is. When I order a veggie burger, and I'm incredibly clear on why- going so far as to say that I don't even want the bun grilled, just in *case* they use butter- I get to be pissed off when they serve me a turkey burger, and tell me it's veggie. \\n\\nYes, you read that right. They served me a TURKEY BURGER. I mean, I get it- turkey burgers? No substitute for beefy goodness. But it's STILL MEAT. I know I don't eat it anymore, but I think I know the difference. So I demurely spit the meat into my napkin, and call the waitress over. I ask- are you SURE this isn't turkey?\\n\\nShe goes in to the kitchen, comes back and promises me it's a veggie burger. I don't want to ruin my last time hanging out with my friends in AZ, so I nod and say ok. But this absolutely ruined the day for my wife and I. If it wasn't for the beer, it would have been a complete loss- but then, that's what beer is supposed to do. Make bad things better. \\n\\nSo to Nimbus, I say I'll keep drinking your tasty brews, but teach your staff what vegan means. It's actually kind of a popular thing these days. \\n\\nAnd one more thing: tell the dude in the monkey suit to leave people alone. I just about knocked him out.",

            "input": "I recently began going to Hot Yoga Ahwatukee as it is close to work and convenient for after work classes. I like the facility, it is very spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and welcoming. This place is like the Tardis (for you whovians), it is way bigger on the inside. The classes vary depending on the instructor. I like to go to the 4 o clock class, which is a one hour class, but have also attended the 5:15 class which is 75 minutes long. I will say, this is a less intense yoga practice, sort of between bikram and sumits, it is slower and less intense than sumits, but not so slow and somewhat boring like Bikram is.... it truly is a happy medium. The room isn't as humid or hot as others I have been to in town (leaving here, I look like a slightly sweaty person, not a person who just jumped in a pool), and the classes have been busy, but not so busy that I have to be on top of the people next to me (which is great!). I would suggest this location for anyone looking for a nice middle of the road difficulty yoga class that will give you a nice, yet relaxing, workout and leave you feeling good after. As long as I work in the area, I will continue to attend this studio.",
