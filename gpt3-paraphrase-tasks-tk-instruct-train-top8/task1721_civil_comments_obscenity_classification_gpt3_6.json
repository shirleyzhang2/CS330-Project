            "input": "A significant problem with the postsecondary education system is that it has become too easy for students to borrow money to pursue degrees that do not yield incomes great enough to pay back the loans. There is a disconnect between the cost of education and the return on the investment.  Some of this easy money is targeted by university recruitment teams by selling amenities to students that are borrowing money focused on degrees that will not yield jobs.  Many professors are chasing these dollars from students that really cannot afford the costs.  The competition for the easy money desired by professors is driving up the costs of education on the backs of many students that are being enslaved by the government's easy money programs.  Add in more government subsidies and the problem get worse.",

Why don't we make this a movie friendly state and bring the movie making to Alaska, the movie incentives. Hell it takes money to make money, but instead they want to take away old people's money, how retarded it that? LEAVE old people's money ALONE!!! they earned it and worked hard for it. THEY DESERVE IT. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY CALL IT THEIR GOLDEN YEARS?\n want to cut this and CUT that out and want Alaska to be primitive. This Kink river bridge to make from the port of Anchorage to the valley, they been talking about that since I was knee high to a grasshopper. Only good thing about that, they will win the Guinness Book of World records for pooping and not getting off the pot, yeah just pooping words.. Just so tired of these Legislators, doing stupid.",

Somehow they convince their voters that everything is the fault of Obama and the Democrats.  So they put them in power and they find out that nothing changes.

I laugh every night watching the nightly news where the GOP is doing all in their power to stop Trump, the guy they created in the first place.  Now they are going to lose the presidency, the Senate and the House.  Could not happen to a nicer group of lying scumbags.",
