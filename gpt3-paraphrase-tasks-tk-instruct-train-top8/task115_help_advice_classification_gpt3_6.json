    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence, determine whether it is a general piece of advice. General advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in a variety of forms, such as Direct advice and Indirect advice. (1) Direct advice is explicit and uses words (e.g., suggest, advice, recommend), verbs (e.g., can, could, should, may), or questions (e.g., why don't you's, how about, have you thought about). (2) Indirect advice is more subtle and contains hints from personal experiences with the intention for someone to do the same thing, or statements that imply an action should (or should not) be taken."
