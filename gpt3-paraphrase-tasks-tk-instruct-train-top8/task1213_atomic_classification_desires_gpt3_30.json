    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether it is plausible for the Head to desire the Tail or not. In this task, desire means desires of sentient entities. For example, doctors likely desire to cure a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
