Florida is obviously desperate for Canadian money given their plans to change the maximum length of stay requirements.  There are not the only ones who feed off of Canadian tourism.  Maybe if we hit them in their pocketbooks, they will change their attitude at the border.",

It is not a unique happening.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, that this store's computers didn't put out regular reports of void activity by checker that would have warned the store manager - or even distant corporate accounting personnel - that there was a problem. \n\nSome retailers even post this information regularly on break room bulletin boards, allowing checkers to constantly compare themselves to their co-workers.  Some retail chains consider repeated void activity to be a productivity issue as well as a theft issue.  A relatively high number of voids can get employees fired even if no theft has occurred.  \n\nWe are talking a lot of theft here.",
