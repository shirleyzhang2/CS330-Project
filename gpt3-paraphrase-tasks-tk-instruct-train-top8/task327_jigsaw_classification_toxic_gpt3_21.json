No, Russia is not our friend, has never been our friend, and will never be our friend. They have a leader (Putin) who is at least a thousand times smarter than the soon-to-be leader of the U.S. (Trump). They are going to buffalo Trump and use him to suit their interests at every turn. It will not be in the best interest of the U.S. or the world. Russia doesn't give a damn about clean air, clean water, reducing global climate change, human rights, or anything that is important to a healthy future of all citizens of the world. In that way, Putin is as idiotic as Trump. They have the idea that if you poison the biosphere that somehow they'll be able to escape the effects because they are rich. Haha, the joke will be on them (and us all). No, Russia is going from a carefully watched foe to a foe that will have free rein over America, thanks to the chump, Trump.",
