The U of O students get free passes and the bums get free bus passes.  I have to tell you, I am not paying $65 a month to ride with junkies and bums, petty little criminals, a drunk puking into the seat next to him or the guy passed out in the back, with five garbage bags at his feet blocking the aisles.

He demonstrates his ignorance on a daily basis.  And when you say he is not in it for the money, please remember he owns businesses which could profit from his actions as president.
