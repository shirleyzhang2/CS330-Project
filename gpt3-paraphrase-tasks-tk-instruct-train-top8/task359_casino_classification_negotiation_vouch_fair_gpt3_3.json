    "Definition": [
        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output 'No'. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy that is used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be done through an explicit call out or an implied call out."
