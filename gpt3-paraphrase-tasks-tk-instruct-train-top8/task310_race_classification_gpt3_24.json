            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks.

            "input": "Article: One morning, Tina and Wesley both wake up with sore throats and stuffy noses. They have the same symptoms, but they react very differently. While Tina reaches for water and vitamins, her husband, Wesley, reached for the phone. \"I'd better make a doctor's appointment,\" he says. Why do these two Chinese people react to sickness so differently? Tina grew up in the U.S. Wesley grew up in Taiwan. And they have discovered that differences between Chinese and American cultures extend   to every area of life. Even sickness and health. When Westerners experience pain, they usually express their discomfort. Most Asians don't. This creates a challenge for American nurses who care for Asian patients in the U.S. How do they know if that calm, quiet patient is really hurting? They have to keep asking their Asian patients how they feel. In addition, Americans usually don't want sickness to slow them down. Unlike Chinese people, Americans often don't take time off work to rest and get well. They'd rather sneeze and cough all day at the office. Americans who get sick in Asia may protest   when Chinese friends suggest they go to the hospital. \"I'm not that sick!\" they may say. In the U.S., only very sick or injured patients go to hospital. People go to a doctor's office for less serious problems. Like Tina, Americans more often turn to vitamins or over-the-counter drugs to help them get well.  Chinese people, however, often head straight for the doctor when they get sick, like Wesley did. They want a prescription   to treat their sickness before it gets serious. Chinese patients often just trust their doctors to give them the information they need. Most Americans, however, ask their doctors lots of questions and do research. American patients want to know everything they can about their condition. So, are one culture's attitudes toward health better than the other's? Perhaps not. Tina and Wesley will both recover from their colds. And today, doctors all over the world are sharing treatment methods with each other. In health, as in everything else, we can learn a lot from each other. \n Question: According to the passage, which of the following might a Chinese not do when he's ill? \n Options: (A) Go to the doctor's.

Since 2008, Li has spent most of her time travelling in Tibet. Four years have passed and she has been almost every corner of Tibet. Li came to Tibet firstly because of her desire for personal freedom. She entered Tibet along the Yunnan-Tibetan road, enjoying the special view happily. She was surprised to find that it is a white paradise  on earth.

            "input": "Article: With an overwhelming variety of educational toys and learning tools in the market, you really wonder if these educational products are really beneficial to children. There have been many educational DVDs in the market that promise to stimulate a child's learning and enhance his or her cognitive skills. Parents feel good about buying these products for their children. After all, these educational tools try to do a parent's job of participating in the child's education, especially when the parent can't be present due to his or her busy schedule. Moreover, children seem to love these DVDs that contain pictures, words, and loads of stories. Some DVDs contain fun, sing-along songs or read-aloud words to help the children learn different concepts and words. Although these are fun for the parents and the children, the question that needs to be asked is whether these DVDs are actually beneficial to the child, as they claim to be. Although parents expected \"educational\" products to give their child some educational advantage, research has shown otherwise. Researchers in a recent study concluded that there was indeed no difference between the language and cognitive ability of the infants who were repeatedly exposed to educational DVDs and those who were not exposed to the DVDs. In fact, contrary to expectations, it was found that babies who were exposed to the DVDs at an earlier age had lower overall language scores at a later age. This suggested a damaging effect of such DVDs on younger children. For several years the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that toddlers under age of 24 months or 2 years should not watch videos or television. However, there are many parents who believe these DVDs really help in stimulating the child and keep him or her entertained. While it may work as a great babysitter, it is important to limit activities like video games, computer games, DVDs or TV programs. To promote their children's development and cognitive skills, parents are advised to spend time with their children and increase interaction with them. For example, if you want to enhance language development, converse with the child, listen, and respond to whatever the child is trying to communicate. Children learn more by interacting with parents, rather than by watching DVDs. \n Question: Many parents love to buy educational DVDs for their children actually because   _  . \n Options: (A) their children have great interest in these DVDs (B) they are sure that these DVDs are beneficial to children (C) these DVDs can share their participation in children's education (D) these DVDs are effective in improving children' s cognitive skills \n Asnwer: C",

Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries.                To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril  . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell.               What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff   or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly   mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other.               Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth  , paying attention to one and then the other. The same thing happens with your nostrils. If they are smelling different smells, your brain pays attention to one and then the other. \n Question: Denise Chen and Wen Zhou discovered that   _  . \n Options: (A) our brain focuses on one thing at a time (B) our two nostrils act differently towards the same smell (C) our nose prefers to smell stronger smells (D) our sense of smell is connected with our sense of sight \n Asnwer: C",

He always dreamed ofbecoming a police officer. Tommy Austin and Ron Cox, two police officers, made his wish come true. They gaveChristopher a tour of the city in a police helicopter and made a real police uniform  for him. There are four kinds of wishes children usually have: I wish to go.

            "input": "Article: Nowadays people are troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what's wrong with a society that presents videos of violence as entertainment. Viewing large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality . Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: \"At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.\" Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out \"the most doubtful measures of aggression\", only 28% supported a connection. The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read \"aggressive\" or \"non-aggressive\" words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intention of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction. Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society. \n Question: Why is there so much violence shown in movies, TV and video games? \n Options: (A) Showing violence is thought to be entertaining. (B) Something has gone wrong with today's society (C) Many people are fond of gunplay and bloodshed. (D) There is a lot of violence in the real world today. \n Asnwer: A",
