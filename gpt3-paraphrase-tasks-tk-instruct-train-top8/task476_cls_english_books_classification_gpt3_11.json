            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",
            "output": "NEG",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

The woman walked in small mincing steps and kept raising her hand to shield her eyes from the vacant sunlight. As if in trance Maria watched the woman, for it seemed to her then that she was watching the dead still center of the world, the quintessential intersection of nothing.\"",

In a post-World-War-III wasteland a religion has grown up around the God of Wrath, whose human embodiment is one Carleton Lufteufel, the government official who detonated the doomsday device that contaminated the Earth's atmosphere with radioactivity. Limbless painter Tibor McMaster sets off in his cart on a quest to find Lufteufel to capture the god's true visage in a painting. There's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated Christianity with this life-negating religion (Deus Irae means \"God of wrath\") and a somewhat Zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel's conclusion. The religious preoccupation gives the novel interest as a kind of reflection of Dick's other greater novels of the late 60s and 70s, despite the somewhat casual and fragmented history of its composition",

As the women explore the similarities and differences in their experiences--from housing arrangements, to elementary school, to their roles in the early months of the Cultural Revolution, to the years spent working in rural China--the reader learns about the wide range of what it means to have grown up in the PRC. The result is a reflective, thought-full, and nuanced look at this tumultuous period in China's recent history",

Dr. Jehle goes through all the signifcant sites at Plymouth and takes you through the history (the real history, not the revisionist, politically correct nonesense that passes for history today) of that site/monument in detail.  He acknowledges the contributions of both the Pilgrims and the native peoples and highlights the strong faith of our founders as well as that of many of those in the native population.  I highly recommend this, especially if you want to teach your children the history of our founding",
