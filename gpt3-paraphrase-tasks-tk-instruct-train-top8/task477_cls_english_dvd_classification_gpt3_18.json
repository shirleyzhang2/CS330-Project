As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

I happened upon the 'O' show, as she spoke about it (wayback when) and I was very intrigued. Before that episode ended, my order was being placed for the DVD version, here. I purchased the CD version, after watching the movie. It was beyond words (I found myself tearing and nodding during most of the movie) and I'm incorporating the Secret in my life as well as my family. I listen to the CD version while getting ready for work in the morning and while doing my work, at night. It has helped me immensely and I'll continue to do so. I'm so very glad that I decided to check here for the hardcover book...hooray, the price has been reduced...yipeee! I'll get that as soon as I'm done with this review. Thanks Rhonda Byrne and aloha from Hawaii",

Woody Allen is playing a novelist named Harry who written books based on people he knowns. He doesn't tries much to disguise them and upsets his friends with his tales. There are funny moments when the movie segues to his fictional characters. My favorite is the one with Demi Moore. The one with Billy Crystal is pretty funny too. In Harry's real life I got a kick out of Cookie the goodhearted prostitute.",

Oh my God, I can't believe they actually released this movie onto video! ...I had the dreadful misfortune of actually watching this film....thank GOD it was on HBO (I actually thought it was an HBO  made-for-tv movie)...anyways, this movie was SOOO bad, I'm surprised that  the Air Force even allowed their aircraft to be photographed for this  movie..seriously..there's no plot and horrendous acting, but what can you  expect from a movie with the title &quot;Stealth Fighter&quot;?  Besides  that, the movie is bad almost to the point of being funny....like the  ending, I won't ruin it or anything (wouldn't that be bad! )......just  don't bend over to pick up your beer (probably #12 by that point in the  movie) because you might miss the whole ending...it's over that quick!    One example of why this movie stinks so bad: Ice-T WALKS onto an Airforce  base...decides to meander over to a hanger, knocks down a couple of  &lt;good&gt; guys that look like offensive-tackle-types...then just jumps  into a Stealth fighter (that happens to have the keys in it, and is fully  gassed up)...and flies away non-chalantly....and he doesn't even rap!   Anyways, might be good if you're inebriated and need a good  laugh....otherwise, avoid this like a port-a-potty at a Buffet  concert...like my roommate says of this movie in the same voice as that guy  from the Simpsons, &quot;Worst.....movie......ever! &quot",

            "input": "Cheap Sopranos rip off falls way short . I like gangster movies and am from Philly so I gave this movie a chance. What a mistake. The creators painstakingly tried to rip off the Sopranos but wound up with a very weak imitation.    It starts with the horrible theme song. It's obviously trying to sound similar to the A3 song that serves as the Sopranos theme, but is chock full of horrible lyrics and sounds like someone threw a Casio keyboard down the stairs and recorded it.    The cast is filled mediocre actors, trying in vain to save a stupid script. One funny thing is that everyone in the film has a different accent, and with the exception of one guy, no one can do a south philly accent.    Sal Mazzotta is trying real hard to be James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, but I'm sorry... he may be a nice guy in real life, but the guy couldn't act scared in a graveyard at midnight. And come on; this guy as a gangster? Maybe as Lurch in the Adams Family.    This movie is also plauged by choppy editing and poor camera work. I mean in a few scenes the camera is actually going in and out of focus while people are talking. Don't they teach that in film school? And usually when two people are talking their heads will be turned to one angle for the wide two person shot, and at completely different angles for close ups, like maybe the close up stuff was done much later.      Save your money. Wish I could get mine back. It's been a long time since I saw a movie so bad I felt angry and ripped off for having seen it.",

Here we have another movie with Ms. Whurer and it is just like most of her movies very very poorly acted and just a waste of time and film for that matter. If all you are looking for is a movie to see her nude than this is for you.  If you are not and you are looking for some entertainment than I sugest that you don't waste your time and money.  I guess when they cast for an actress here all they were looking for was how well she looks with no clothing on and did not pay attention to the simple fact that this woman has no talent",

The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival.

From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie.  Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity.  With the perfect combination of story telling and presentation, one can understand both perspectives, whether it is for Xavier or Magneto.    This movie is nothing but perfect.",

            "input": "The Great Muttering Sailor Man . Opinions are like noses: everyone has one. Some like it, some don't. Let me say this, however, in defense of this 1980 movie starring Robin Williams as Popeye. It is certainly unfair to say, by any stretch, that this is 'the worst movie of all-time', or 'one of the worst...'. It is funny how, at the time of this writing, that the average vote for this film is about 4.5 stars...Actually that is about right. For those who do not know about the wonderful website called The Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com), you really need to check it out. [...] My point is this: There are many opinions. So if you have never seen this movie, decide for yourself. Do you remember the incredible muttering Popeye (done by Jack Mercer on the cartoons)?. I'm talking especially about the early Fleischer Studios Popeye cartoons from the 30's. You know, the ones in black-and-white. That's what I loved the most, the muttering Popeye. Well, Robin Williams does it superbly! Also, Shelly Duvall is excellent as Olive Oyl in this movie. Granted, the story is kind of bland. The music is not always top notch. Yes, it is too long. However, I enjoyed watching Robin Williams' masterful portrayal of everyone's favorite Sailor Man. Sure, Olive can get a little annoying at times, but wasn't she basically that way in the cartoons? So if you loved the muttering Popeye, then you'll love the movie, overall. Never mind the story. The storyline doesn't really matter, I feel. But, alas, you say you cannot really remember those vintage Popeye cartoon shorts too well. Not to worry! They are scheduled to be released on DVD... FULLY RESTORED!!! Volume 1 (1933 - 1938), with a July 2007 scheduled release, will have, in my opinion, the very best of all the 230 total Popeye cartoon shorts. (Incidently, William Costello provided Popeye's voice from 1933 until sometime in 1935. He was very good also, but the really GREAT muttering came when Jack Mercer took over in 1935). By all means, if you are a huge Popeye fan like myself, then you absolutely must get these DVDs. After listening to the great Jack Mercer, and watching the incredible animation in those early years, then compare Popeye to Robin Williams' version. I dare say, you will see the similarity. So, the bottom line is: See for yourself. If you love Popeye, the character, then you will not be disappointed with Robin Williams' performance. The movie itself... well, you be the judge. Likely you have a nose, so without a doubt you, too will have an opinion. It's ALL alright.",
