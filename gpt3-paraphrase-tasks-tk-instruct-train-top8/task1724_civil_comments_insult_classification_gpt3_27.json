That is exactly why the US Congress is in nearly perpetual session. They weren't supposed to be and it has had far ranging consequences. We shouldn't want to go there.\n\nThe Alaska Leg session was originally only supposed to be 90 days, according to the State Constitution. Some other states have much shorter sessions and manage to get things done.\n\nThe length of session is not the problem. The legislators need to prioritize. Constitutionally, the ONLY job they have is passing a budget. They could do that in 90 days if they concentrated. Watch 360 North's Gavel to Gavel sometime and you'll see a lot of wasted time. If they started with the budget and, then, if they had time, they did these other things ... that would solve the problem right there. Lengthening the session would only encourage them not to get the work done.",

When those occur, police departments need to re-evaluate their way of doing things.\n\nHowever, the biggest reform that should occur is the understanding that ALL LIVES MATTER. Cops should never treat the public as if we are all criminals in need of correction (or the Department of ), but as individuals who by and large aren't meaning to break the increasingly complex laws of this increasingly tyrannical government. If they approached all of their jobs in that way, there would be a whole lot fewer shootings, period! Any time a cop shoots a civilian, the facts should be screened by a citizen jury to assure there is no cover-up and if that jury decides there is cause, the cop should go to trial for Murder 1. Right there, shootings would drop dramatically.",
