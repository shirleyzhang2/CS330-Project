        "You will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your task is to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by concatenating extracts taken from the context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using novel sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, one that affirms the question and one that denies the question. Typically, the choices are either yes or no."

These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5. On the other hand, if it is equal to or higher than 4, it is assumed to be positive.
