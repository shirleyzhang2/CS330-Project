I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

This is from a FULL battery, mind you.

Not so; the ball in the side of the square drive is properly spring-loaded, but the sockets just pull off as with any less expensive socket adaptors. More important is that they do not properly fit and lock into my impact drivers. I must, therefore, hold the adapter in place for use. \n Rating: 3",
