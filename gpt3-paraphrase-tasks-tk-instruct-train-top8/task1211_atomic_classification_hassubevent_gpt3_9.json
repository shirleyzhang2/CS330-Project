        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail will be events that are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You will need to determine whether the Head includes an event or an action in the Tail. This happens when the Tail denotes a step within the larger head event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
