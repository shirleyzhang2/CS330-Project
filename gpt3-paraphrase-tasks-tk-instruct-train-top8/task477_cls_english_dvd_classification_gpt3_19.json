As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",

            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.    Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows",

Fiercely loyal to his fellow slaves and the fight for justice he leads his men to freedom and life on the high seas as pirates!  Arrrrrrrgh!    Highly entertaining from beginning to end, normally when a film gets boring I bust off a few rattlers to liven things up but there was no need for that here!  This film didn't let up for a minute.  Even the talking parts were exciting thanks to the story and the chemistry between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, who by the way is smoking hot in this movie.    Another reason to get this DVD or even better yet the Flynn box set is the great extras including a informative 22-minute featurette called \"Captain Blood: A Swashbuckler Is Born\".  Did you know co-star Ross Alexander committed suicide at the age of 29 using the same rifle that his wife had committed suicide with?!  Yikes.    Also check out the score by Erich Korngold",

            "input": "A highly original Western comedy... . A 1990's Western comedy featuring Mel Gibson, Maverick was a breath of fresh air when first appeared in theaters. The film doesn't take itself so seriously as many films with a Western setting tend to do. Based on the 1950's television series by the same name in which James Garner had a starring role, Maverick is a uniquely clever and entertaining adventure comedy...    When Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) needs $25,000 to enter a winner-take-all poker tournament, he travels through towns en route to the tournament in the hopes of winning every dollar he needs. But he quickly encounters Angel (Alfred Molina), a roughneck poker player in his own right who tries to kill Maverick (his attempt inevitably fails).    Along the way, Maverick meets up with Ms. Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) - a slick, conniving poker player who picks Maverick's pocket following a brief romantic encounter. When Maverick catches her, he forces her to wash his shirt as punishment. Shrinking his designer shirt, Annabelle runs off to catch a riverboat with Maverick running after her. After boarding the boat, the two are joined by Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) - a kind, retired sheriff famous throughout the West. Cooper's chivalry and hospitality greatly contrast with Maverick's brisk demeanor when it comes to dealing with Ms. Bransford.    As the three travel cross country, they face a series of pitfalls such as a dead coach driver who almost runs their coach off the top of a cliff, a showdown with hundreds of Indians, and Maverick's financial dealings with an Archduke from Russia. Separated in the confusion, the three eventually meet again on the Riverboat Lauren Belle, home of the championship poker game hosted by the riverboat's owner Commodore Duvall. Making use of his quick wit, Maverick raises the extra cash he needs to join the poker game (as well as a few thousand extra for Annabelle Bransford). Commodore Duvall puts Marshal Zane Cooper in charge of guarding the $500,000 in entry fees for the tournament in which Angel also happens to be a participant.  But in addition to beating Angel, Maverick faces other obstacles of even greater challenge...    Overall, Maverick is great entertainment. The acting is superb on all fronts with standout performances by Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and James Garner. Each of the main characters creates a likeable persona. And what makes this movie a must-see (because the plot leaves much to be desired) is the ability of the on-screen characters to create a personal connection with the audience. Several of the scenes in this film are absolutely hilarious, such as the ones with Joseph (Graham Greene). Maverick isn't the type of movie that will win Academy Awards or leave one pondering the fundamental principles of the universe, but it is a whole lot of fun. And if you want to do is laugh, give this movie a try...    The DVD Repor",

I am shocked it was cancelled after 3 seasons and amazed that it is not more widely accepted as quite possibly the best show on television.

            "input": "humanity of jack . Nothing happened to Jack Kerouac. He died like the rest of us eventually will. Jack Kerouac was a regular human being. Now you're problably saying &quot;yea I already knew that, so what?&quot;. But what you problably  didn't know is that Jack used literature to show how beautiful and ugly  human beings can be. Kerouac was a man equally feminine as he was masculine  (read Charter's biography about his relationships with Ginzy, N.C., as well  as the women of his life.) All of this is touched on in the video  documentary, which thrives off the somber emotion,and that sort of  &quot;grey sky comtemplation&quot; of things, which seems to pervade all of  Jack's work.  The video moves through Jack's life in a fairly  straightforward manner. We see him as a shy french speaking Mass.  adolescent, a cleft chinned Columbia undergraduate, a rucksack wanderer,a  chanting buddhist,an aloof catholic, who loved his mother and drank much  too much Johnnie Walker.  In &quot;What happnened to Jack?&quot; we see  Jack as who he really was, a confused, tortured, disenfranchised,happy,  unhappy writer who was very good at putting words together, which gave an  honest glimpse of what was going on in his heart and his mind.  There are  many great moments in the video. Any beat &quot;junkie&quot; will love the  footage of Jack and Allen coolin' it near Columbia, smoking cigarettes and  shootin' pool.  There's a clip of Bird and Diz blowing hot jazz, the beats  in S.F. at the debut of Ginzy's &quot;Howl&quot;, Mike McClure, Jack,  Snyder and Ferlinghetti at Big Sur recitin' and writin' smooth synapses of  the happenings there and around. There are countless anecdotes and picturs  of all your &quot;beat heroes&quot;, which portray them as strikingly  regular and very un-heroic.    The video as a complete work is very  delicious, but the tastiest bits come when Jack reads &quot;October in the  Railroad Earth&quot; to a montage of San Francisco images. When a debonair   Jack reads &quot;On the Road&quot; to Steve Allen's bluesy piano in perfect  phrasing and time. And last but not least there is the comical and  strangely serious Greg Corso explaining genious, fame, and why he thinks  the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; was a phenomenon. Kerouac would problably  want you to see this video because it shows that he was not a fad, an icon,  nor a saviour for a generation. He was simply a regular man trying to find  answers to very un-regular questions and he used his writing talent to  unravel those mysteries",

With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.    I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream...",

            "input": "If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, then you may like this . This is your standard, generic, run-of-the mill comedy, with Ben Stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc. and Jennifer Anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible.  Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.    If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, \"oh, that was supposed to be funny\", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?  Are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them, and they act like a complete loon?  I mean, come on.  This crap was old when they were doing it on the Carol Burnett Show 30 years ago.     Anyhow, if you're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight, brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time, then you'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else. It's probably better than reruns on the Cooking Channel, but only by the slimmest of margins",
