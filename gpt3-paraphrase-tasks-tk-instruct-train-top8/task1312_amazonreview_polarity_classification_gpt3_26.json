I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

Saved a lot of labor. DON'T use a high pressure water source it will spilt the plastic and create a leak. Normal water hose pressure does the trick, live and learn I guess. Used glue and fixed the first one and reordered another one. If it came in metal, that would be great, but didn't see one. Enjoy, bottom line, It worked for me.",

            "input": "My introduction to this product was on the TV show Shark Tank. I had a puppy at the time who was too young for typical flea & tick products. I liked that it was safe to use on baby animals as well as safe to use around children & anything in the house so I decided to try the product. It was expensive for the 16 ounce bottle I bought at my pet store, but it was worth it! It took a few uses for my puppy to get used to being sprayed, but once she got the rub down she was hooked & she was flea & tick free. Then summer came & we had an infestation of ants in my kitchen (I bake a lot). I got online to read more about other products in the Wondercide line & read that it repels ants as well so I tried it on a trail of ants & it worked! Now that I have a new puppy to add to my family, I use the flea & tick product again and I now order the house & garden product for the ants when they come. They really don't like it & seem to stay away as long as I spray. Thank you Amazon for selling the products at more affordable prices! And I love the smell of the product!!",
