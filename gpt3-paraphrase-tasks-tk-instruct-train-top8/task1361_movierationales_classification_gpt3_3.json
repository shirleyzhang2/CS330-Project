in - law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical .\nwhat 's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro .\nalthough it 's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .\nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .\nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact .\nfinn 's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .\nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful .\nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .\nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare 's romeo+juliet ) .\nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock .\nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it ,\nyou 'd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .",
