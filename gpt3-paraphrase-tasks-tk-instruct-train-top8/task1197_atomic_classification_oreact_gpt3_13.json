    "Definition": [
        "Given a tuple comprising Head and Tail events, separated by <sep>, you have to determine whether the result of the Head event leads to the feeling mentioned in the Tail event for PersonY or other participants. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, if the Head event is gift-giving, the result might be that others (in this case, PersonY) feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
