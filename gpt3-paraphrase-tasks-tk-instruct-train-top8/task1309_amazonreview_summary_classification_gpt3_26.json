            "input": "Reviews: I purchased this pump to replace the little one that came with my 10ft easy set pool. The original was noisy and barely moved any water. It would not keep the pool clean and the filter had to be changed at least 3x a week. The pool is on a patio, so there is no dirt getting in it. The new pump moves a considerable amount more water and hooked right up to the old connections. The filter can go 1-2 weeks with no problem and the pool stays clean. This pump is a little noisy as well. It\u2019s outside our bedroom sliding door, otherwise I doubt I would really hear it. Update: The pump got noisy in the middle of the night and quit working completely. The breaker tripped and it shut off. Went to check it this morning and the motor is stuck. Water is leaking from the bottom of the motor area. I will call Intex tomorrow, as they are closed on the weekend. Warranty is said to be 1 year and I am about a week shy of that now. I will update again regarding the warranty process. \n Summary: ... about it you do sell there products i will like this very",
