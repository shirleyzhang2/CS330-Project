I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched.",

I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking).

I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)...
