I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",

They're comfortable, easy to handle and I really enjoy the sound with this. The mic works perfectly as well and does a good job of cancelling out all any extraneous noise. I used to have Beats Studio headphones which I loved so I could tune it all out, but these work just as good and for a fraction of the price. Personally, if they broke I would just buy a new pair. I highly recommend them.",
