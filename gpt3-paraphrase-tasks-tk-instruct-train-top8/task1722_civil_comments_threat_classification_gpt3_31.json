However, he adds CONTEXT: \"Between 1939 and 1945, close to 670,000 Koreans were brought to Japan for fixed terms of work, mostly in mines and heavy industry, and it has been estimated that 60,000 or more\u00a0of\u00a0them died under  the harsh conditions of their work places.  Over 10,000 others were probably killed in the atomic bombing of  Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\" (p. 47)\n\nNow, LFS2, a question- were you suggesting that  postwar South Korea's leaders were more likely to\u00a0have been Korean \"Quislings?\" Sounds like the old \"East Germany- West Germany\" argument.",

Even in software, there has been activity for decades with game companies and educational software employing up to hundreds back to the early nineties.  But beyond the tiny software industry tens of thousands are employed in other lines of work and new companies are starting all the time but without incubators or fan fare.  Software jockey's tend to think highly of themselves, but those of use who have started high tech manufacturing companies and such see the focus to be a bit misplaced.  The overall health of the local economy is dependent on a broad spectrum of activity far beyond software.  Software is a small and competitive industry.  Local focus should support the broader spectrum of new business including manufacturing, timber, medical, etc.",
