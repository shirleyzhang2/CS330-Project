    "Definition": [
        "You are given a tweet that contains irony. You must classify the type of irony in the tweet. The types of irony are \"polarity\", \"situational\", and \"other\". \"Polarity\" irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. \"Other\" is for any irony that is neither \"polarity\" nor \"situational\"."
