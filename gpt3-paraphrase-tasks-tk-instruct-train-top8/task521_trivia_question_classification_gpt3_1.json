            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke.

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",

            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."
