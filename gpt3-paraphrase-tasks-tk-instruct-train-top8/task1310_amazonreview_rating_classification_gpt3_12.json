I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m.

They are very bright and have held up to the weather quite nicely. I have them dimmed down as low as possible, and they are still a little bit too bright for the steps, but they do the job and look really good. It would be nice if they made a model specifically designed just for steps that would angle the LED light field down instead of straight out. It would also be nice to see the finish available in a darker version, like bronze.",
