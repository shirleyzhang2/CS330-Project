Just something to ponder.....  Too scary for me to even think about........\nI am most sorry for my grandchildren, and what they may be in store for, with regards to future medical care.",

I'm trying to figure out what you're saying here:  Don't you think recycling is a little better than digging it up (or chopping it down) and throwing it in a landfill?  Yes, it takes effort, equipment, and infrastructure---I hope we as a  society are able to engage in a science-and-evidence-based discussion over whether the net result is really worth it.  \n\nI've read studies that indicate we could possibly phase out fossil fuels in a decade:  I can see that as a possible motive for oil producers to flood the market and drive the price of their product down, and try to shift this discussion to the background for as long as possible, with the \"help\" of people like Sarah and you.",
