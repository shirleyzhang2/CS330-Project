up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot .\n\"\ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department .\nit feels like reality , like you 're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .\nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .\nwe see key moments in people 's lives that they would n't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically - showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it 's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three - dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the - truth - at - all - costs reasoning out of the water\n.\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they could n't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .\nand yes , it 's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier\n, we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he 's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .\neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .\nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .\nas such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it 's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .",
