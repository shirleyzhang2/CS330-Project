I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

            "input": "Reviews: Got these headphones and loved them. Sound quality is exceptional for the price. They are great looking headphones, nice size and very comfortable. Then 2 weeks after purchasing them, I pulled them out of my backpack and one earpiece was snapped off. the earpiece is held on by a very small weld (see attached photo). I was tempted to replace the pair, since I really did love them, but it is not worth the risk since I would lose my return window. Seeing how small the weld is and the fact the the headphone band is spring steel which you need to flex constantly to put on or take off the headphones, I am really not sure of the durability. It really is a shame since these are really great headphones. Not sure if this is just an anomaly- please let me know in the comments if you have had a similar experience. \n Category: apparel",
