People say don't blame the victim, I get that, but I'm willing to bet $100 that in the majority of these cases of sexual violence, a window of opportunity was left open. \"Alcohol doesn't cause sexual assault, it creates opportunity\" is a perfect example, add weed to that as well. People let their guard down when substances are used to have fun. Whether the victim themselves are using it or not is not the singular factor -- but the environment of where the victim and perpetrator are can influence that so much, and to a degree, makes it so much easier for predator to find and assault his or her victim(s). Seems that Alaskans take more thought in protecting themselves from bears, moose, etc. than they do from sexual crimes. Prevention can be a help to this epidemic. It won't fix the problem, but it will definitely help mitigate it.",
