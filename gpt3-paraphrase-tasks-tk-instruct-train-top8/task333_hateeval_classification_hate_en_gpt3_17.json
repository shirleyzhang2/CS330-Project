        "You will be given a post from an online platform, and you are expected to label it as \"hateful\" or \"Non-hateful\". A post is considered hateful if it expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or a group. If a post is hateful but not towards immigrants and women, it should be labeled as non-hateful. Note that the URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
