I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

I was unable to keep a nice even tension on the yarn because it seemed to stretch. The color was dull, unlike the picture where it looked vibrant. It was difficult to get out of the skein, too, as it was often knotted and tangled. Very disappointed.",

However, after hooking up my Oculus VR and another monitor I found out my HDMI port was dead in the graphics card. Did multiple tests and even updated CPU and MOBO. Nothing fixed it so I tested my older card and all the equipment worked fine. Sadly after saving up money for the now MOBO and Graphics I was unable to return due to the 30 day wait. (I am a college kid getting married its hard to scrape up that kinda money). So I am stuck with a $500+ card that has a broken HDMI port.",
