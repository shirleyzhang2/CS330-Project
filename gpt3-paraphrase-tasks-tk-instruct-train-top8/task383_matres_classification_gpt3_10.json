        "You will be given a context and a verb separated by a newline character. You have to output \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time and \"No\" otherwise. A verb can be anchored in the real timeline if and only if a verb happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
