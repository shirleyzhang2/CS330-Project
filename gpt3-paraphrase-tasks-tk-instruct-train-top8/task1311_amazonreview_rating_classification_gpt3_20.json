I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months!

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

As a result, I will not remove the review and am lowering my review to 1 star. I have pretty big hands so finding gloves that fit is hard; so I was pleased to see that according to the sizing guide in description for this gloves, I should be an ideal fit for the XL size of these gloves. Unfortunately, I think the measurements on the sizing chart may be a bit optimistic - I could barely fit my hand into the opening, and once on I could barely articulate my fingers they were so tight! Overall though I thought the gloves looked and felt pretty nice; if you're looking at these and have more regular hands, I would advise considering going one size up on these otherwise decent gloves. \n Rating: 1",
