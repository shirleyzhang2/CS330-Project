Oddly, many folks think growers are dripping with money. Perhaps some are but most growers are barely making it pay. I grow medical grade, sun grown cannabis for my own use and for two others who are quite ill and physically unable to participate. We produce one crop annually that fills the jars for the coming year. My patients contribute financially to offset the fixed costs of stock acquisition, soil, amendments, propagation, water, labor, drying, curing, weighing, etc.  It's production farming so I recommend getting as close to the source as possible and avoid the dispensary blues.",

A portion of the population seems strangely anti-education, and some these people are in charge of \u201cfixing the deficit\u201d, which begs questions over our collective future.  A majority of citizens support  education in general for their families, but do they want only educated baristas and cashiers?
