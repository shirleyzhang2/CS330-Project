    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, such as suggesting that they have ample water to spare. The no-need strategy can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
