These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

Fortunately I was able to use those for drawers and keep the three inch handles for the cupboards. Had that not worked out, I was close to having to return them. The second box was ok.....thirty handles with three inch spacing as advertised. So check the contents carefully when you get them.....I think I saw other reviews where people didn't get all three inch handles.

I have only had for one week but the finish is holding up nicely. Wear every day for the most part, most of the day. Great purchase, as there were no reviews wanted to provide something for others. *** UPDATE 6 WEEKS later, product broke, band slipped out of watch connection. Started to fade shortly after this review. Overall don't waste your money, unless you're looking for a band that will last you about 2-3 months \n Polarity: negative",
