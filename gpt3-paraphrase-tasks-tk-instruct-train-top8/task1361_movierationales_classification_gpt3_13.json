            "input": "an american werewolf in london is john landis ' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england .\nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .\nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .\neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive .\nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive .\nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .\nif it were n't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .\nand with good reason --\nthe acting is n't great and neither is the writing .\nwell ok , we do n't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .\nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it is n't scary .\nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens .\nyou do n't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .\ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen .\nbut john ,\nit just was n't scary .\ni did n't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and\nthe whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it did n't work for me .\nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films .\nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .\nit 's never a good sign that you do n't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material .\ncall me crazy , but you should n't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .\ni 'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up .\nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) .\nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy .\nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital .\nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse .\ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works .\nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie .\nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . while they are still impressive today , they are n't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .\nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch .\nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it does n't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .",

            "input": "\" flubber \" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of\na film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney .\nit 's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it 's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless .\nwhat could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it 's a shame because it could have been a great film .\nhypothetically , i mean .\n\" flubber , \" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , \" the absent minded professor , \" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as \" flubber , \" you know , flying rubber ?\nthe new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent - mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several \" show - stopping \" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups ,\nnone which really make it any better , but instead make it worse .\nthe basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded .\nin fact , he 's forgotten his wedding to the college 's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning .\ndoes n't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ?\nanyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in \" the abyss .\n\" philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon / villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to .\nthrough a plot twist , hoenicker 's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he 's evil enough .\na sub - plot involves philip 's attempts to win back sara , who 's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip 's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave - yet - unsuave asswhole once again ) .\nand in another subplot , philip 's day - timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one - and - only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him .\nyuckity - yuck .\nwhat 's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is .\nyou do n't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half - assedly re - mixing classics ( or non - classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up .\nearlier in ' 97 , they released \" jungle 2 jungle , \" an adaptation of a really awful french film , \" un indien dans la ville , \" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much .\ndisney 's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively .\nin the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called \" magic .\n\" such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending\nall fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh .\ni sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes\n.\nwho could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ?\ndid n't think so .\nit does n't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable .\nphilip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams .\nwilliams is a brilliant comic actor .\n. .\nokay ,\na brilliant actor in general , but here\nhe 's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad .\nthose times , he 's not bad .\nbut what are we supposed to think of a man who 's forgotten his wedding thrice ?\nmaybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . .\ni like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for \" hercules , \" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster\n, they 've been pathetic .\n\" jungle 2 jungle \" is probably the worst film i saw last year .\n\" flubber \" 's probably second .\nwhat do they need to do ?\nperhaps create something new .\nget writers who can write something that 's universally entertaining .\nfilms like \" the parent trap \" and \" mary poppins \" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they 're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults .\nwhat 's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ?\nand my god , could n't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?",
