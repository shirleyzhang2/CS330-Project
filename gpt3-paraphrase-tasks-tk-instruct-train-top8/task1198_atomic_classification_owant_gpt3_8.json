    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple, comprising Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail or not. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
