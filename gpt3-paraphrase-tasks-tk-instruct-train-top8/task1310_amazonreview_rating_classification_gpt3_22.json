I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

Quality overall is very good. Head rest may prove to short even when adjust to it's highest position for people with broad shoulders and 'normal' torso length. Arms not very sturdy, not adjustable (I missed this in the description--my issue). Overall, for the price, will work for the time-being. Comfortable enough, but not a top tier product--quality = pricing so I'm happy.",

Just a heads up: they'll need to be washed frequently since your pet's paws will sweat and cause a stinky feet odor. (At least that's what happened with us). Also, keep your pet's nails trimmed! Our booties only lasted about 45 days because his nails busted through the fabric part of the bootie....We already need a replacement pair; so for that reason (cost vs. ROI) I rate them 3 stars.",
