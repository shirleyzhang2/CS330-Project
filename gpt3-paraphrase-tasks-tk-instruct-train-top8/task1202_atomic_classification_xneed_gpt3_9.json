    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. You have to determine whether the subject of the Head event needs what is mentioned in the Tail event before the Head event or not. Here need is a precondition for the subject of the Head event to achieve the event. For example, in order for the subject of the Head event to give gifts, the subject must first buy the presents. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
