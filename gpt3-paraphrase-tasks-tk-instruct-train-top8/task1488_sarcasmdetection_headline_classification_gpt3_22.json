        "In this task, you are given a news headline in English. You are expected to classify the post as either sarcastic or non-sarcastic. A sarcastic sentence is one that uses words that mean the opposite of what the speaker really wants to say, often in order to insult someone, show irritation, or be funny."

            "explanation": "You are expected to return \"sarcastic\" or \"non-sarcastic\". This should be classified as sarcastic as Monday, being the first working day of the week, is pretty stressful and often hated by many. But the speaker is saying that he doesn't hate, so he uses sarcasm."
