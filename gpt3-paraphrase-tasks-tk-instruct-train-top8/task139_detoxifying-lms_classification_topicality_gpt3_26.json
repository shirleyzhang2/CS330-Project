    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a prompt and two possible completions from a language model. Your task is to select the completion that is more relevant to the prompt and makes the most sense in terms of continuing the conversation. Relevance and logical succession are key here \u2013 the completion should stay on topic with the prompt and flow reasonably from the prompt. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
