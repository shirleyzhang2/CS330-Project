        "In this task, you will be given a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending. Your task is to determine which of the two potential middles makes the story incoherent or implausible, and to output 1 or 2 accordingly. If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes less sense."

            "output": "2",

            "output": "1",

            "output": "1",
