He vowed not to reinstate enhanced interrogation techniques -- even if ordered to do so by Trump -- and took a harder line on Russia than Trump has displayed.

Robert Mueller's appointment Wednesday as special counsel to probe Russian election meddling and any collusion by Trump campaign aides elevates the investigation clear of partisanship and the threat of White House interference. It therefore may offer the best chance for a politically bulletproof accounting of the guilt or innocence of members of the President's inner circle.

Barack Obama said in November 2007. His administration put a two-year ban on lobbying post-service. In 2016, Trump channeled the same anger against Washington and is proposing to build on the same policies Obama instituted. \"Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose the Trump campaign. That's because I don't need them. I don't want them. I'm going to do what's good for you,\" Trump said in Akron, Ohio, in August. \"Or some big-time lobbyist says they oppose Donald Trump's campaign.
