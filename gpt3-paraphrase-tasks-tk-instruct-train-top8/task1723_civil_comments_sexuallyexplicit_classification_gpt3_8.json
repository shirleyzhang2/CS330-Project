As far as I know, the physical attributes each human is born with is not a matter of choice. After birth, humans have many years to make a decision as to what their sexuality will be or even may be born understanding what their sexuality will be at sexual maturity. Some may even identify as being a different sex than at birth. I agree that there are perhaps lesser or greater variations of bi-sexuality that permeate all human beings to a lesser or greater extent. The exploration and discovery about ourselves continues and will be either exciting or dreaded, depending on your views and experiences.",

Rangers, LURPs, Loch pilots, medics, grunts and officers; they smoked on patrol or when flying helicopters and they lived to tell their tales. Many believed it enhanced their perception in the jungle which is a positive thing. It was not always recreational. The Army must have known how widespread this was. No stereotype just a different group of men than your Dad served with with a different perspective..",
