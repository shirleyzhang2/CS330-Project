        "You will be given a short poem, and you must predict if the poem was written by a kid in elementary school or high school. 1st to 6th-grade kids are considered as in elementary school, and 7th to 12th-grade kids are considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs, 'elementary' and 'high'. All inputs will have at least one output, and no input can have both outputs at the same time."
