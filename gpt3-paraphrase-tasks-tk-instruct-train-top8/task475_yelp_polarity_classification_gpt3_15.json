The bar had a nice mellow atmosphere, with customers bantering to each other about the various sports games on the monitors.  The bartender immediately came by to take my drink order and give me a menu when one of the bar guests who probably had some money riding on a college football game started screaming when his team gave up the ball.  Along with the other bar goers, the bar tender jeered him in good humor while pouring my Newcastle.  \\n\\nAces is the kind of place that makes you feel like a regular even if you've never been.  Their beer selection is okay, but the quality of the food is outstanding.  I ordered a Reuben that totally knocked my socks off, it came out quickly, and could go toe to toe with any NYC deli creation.  This was a pleasant experience, between the good food, company, atmosphere, and friendly, not fake-friendly, service.  I will definitely be back!",

This place is scarier during the day than it is at night. It's actually only a little bit crummy to be fair - it has a few bar games and pool and places to sit and drink and it only smells a little bit like rotten fruit and B.O.\\n\\nI don't really get the crowd here. Locals and burnouts mixed with some pretty cool looking folk. Hard to get a read on it, but I don't see this place being a huge draw for hipsters or anyone with a pulse. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and the staff seems pretty friendly. Even with all the video games, shuffle board and pool - if you wanted to have a really fun time here, you might have to bring your own fun... and at least a few friends to help you carry it.",

            "input": "Well... Let's see, I've been to Honey Salt three times now and honestly not sure I'll go back again. I consider myself pretty knowledgable about restaurants and food in general and I just consider my recent experience as unexciting. The food is a little on the expensive side (very comparable to strip hotel prices) and just blah. I understand this restaurant is big into the farm to table mentality (so over this catch phrase) and utilize mostly local vendors but really $170 for lunch for six with no apps or alcohol and one ate from the children's menu. Half of us had water, our splurge was a couple desserts.\\n\\n   I guess the biggest letdown was the less than stellar food. My daughter had pasta with butter and cheese on kid's menu, no cheese and it was maybe 3/4 cup of pasta with olive oil salt and pepper, $8. Side of kids edamame, $4. Then my husband had the burger, $17, overcooked, forgot his bacon he ordered with it and the fries, well let's just say they need to change the fryer oil. So... While it was not awful, our lunch today was just very blah. In retrospect there are so many other places I would have rather spent my money.",

            "input": "Usually one of my favorite stops during first fridays or second Saturdays. \\n\\nMusic: Depending on what day you go this joint can play a variety of EDM genres. Not my usual cup of tea but my most recent experience was a tech house night. To my surprise I loved it. It felt like a very down town lounge urban underground LA night. If your standing outside Vanguard as you walk pass it you can definitely hear they're amazing sound system bumping. Its the loudest on the busy bar hoping street. Cover is always free so if you looking for some good beats and down town love go to Van guard.\\n\\nPrice of drinks: A bit pricey for a small location, but I guess it was the weekend. The prices were a bit high and the drinks weren't that strong. \\n\\nJust a note: I suggest going to El Cortez's bar and grabbing a few cheap drinks before heading to Van guard. The amount you'd spend on one drink at Van guard would equal about 2 drinks at El Cortez. Also find a FREE parking garage El Cortez is no longer a free parking garage even though they have a HUGE sign that says FREE parking LOL False advertisement!!!",

In fact, the only thing that had a flavor was the shrimp clay pot I ordered and that's only because the shrimp were spoiled! It was so disgusting I couldn't get the pungent taste of off seafood out of my mouth the rest of my night. I was so scared I'd spend the rest of my vacation with food poisoning I ran straight to the rooftop bar and immediately downed a huge shot of vodka and prayed that would sterilize what was undoubtedly festering in my stomach. I've had gas station food that was fresher than this. I know my dim sum and this stuff was not even close! Also the server was very rude. There are so many fantastic places to eat in Vegas, don't even bother with this health inspector's nightmare.",
