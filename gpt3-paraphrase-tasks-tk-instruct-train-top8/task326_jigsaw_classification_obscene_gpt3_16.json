        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

Wilson was a replacement for Gattis. The lesser of two   evils there. The red headed step child,?. That situation is a whole new level of ignorance, probably a buddy of that other Wasillian so enamored with the female reproductive process. The latest influx of bad Karma appears to emanate  from peckerwood paradise, Georgia. The insidious infestation of soulless Southerners has slackened somewhat due to their oil masters hiring out of state scab labor, a respite well deserved. Not to worry though, secure enclaves of civil intellect do exist, while Palmer has burdened themselves with tea party trash, Parnell and crew, Wasilla has the Palin legacy to contend with, after all that, I still have hope, where else can a person pay their Church tithes in bullets?.",
