            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.     I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.     I really couldn't recommend this book any less",

I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming.",

I thoroughly enjoyed it at that time, and have used it as a reference ever since.  What so many do not realize is that different treatments (distillation vs. tincture vs. absolute vs. hydrosol, etc.) of a plant result in often VERY different properties comprising that substance.  So finally having some insights into the properties of hydrosols, the water remaining from the distillation of a plant, is/was much needed.  No other work like it had been available.    And what a revelation about many of them.  Most people, even those working with essential oils and their cousins were not aware of what this or that hydrosol might do, let alone how to get their hands on it.    Really needed and really wonderful work",

            "input": "Not hippy new age philosophy taoism . For good and ill, I am one of the hippy westerners the book talks about.  The little I know of Taoism I know from a conversation with a friend and reading The Tao of Pooh.  I bought this book while trying to learn more.    The book is very up front about contradicting the seemingly widely held (western) view that Taoism is largely about attitude and how you live life.  This book is not about philosophy.  The book is concrete how-to advice about practicing Taoism in a traditional manner.  Different sections explain how to make your own altar and wand to use in rituals, why taoists should never participate in felatio, and introduce a whole pantheon of dieties to worship.  It would also make a much better source for a school report about a religion than a philosophy text would.    In general, I found the book interesting but not what I needed.    From the start, I was turned off by the tone of the book.  The introduction takes the attitude that new agers are messing up Taoism and people interested in it as a philosophy should get lost.  It makes some pretty broad declaratory statements about how all Taoists live their lives, and tries very hard to push a \"one right way\" to being a Taoist.  The book could easily be completely right, and I'm not an expert to say it isn't, but either it wasn't what I was looking for or Taoism isn't what I am looking for",

            "input": "An Excellent Overview . This work grabs you immediately with its description of the \"standstill\" procedure.  A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter.  Fascinating stuff.      The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery.  The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc.  There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible.  But something was missing.    In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch.  This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases .  Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines.  Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better.  Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus.  Nevertheless, highly recommended",

Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment.  If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others.....",
