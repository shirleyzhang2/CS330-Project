Weren't you ever 15, and wanted to do everything with your friends?  \n\nAlso, didn't you know everything at 15 years old?  I know I did, and it wasn't until I got older that I understood that I actually knew much less than everything no matter my age.\n\nI find it offensive, and in poor form, for you to blame a 15 year old kid for his own death at a supervised and supposedly regulated school outing.",

His flaws go much deeper than that.  I would say that he is incapable of doing a \"good job\" by his very nature. All he has done is deepen the divides in this country because all that matters to him is being adored, and he will do anything - anything - to feed that addiction, even if it destroys the country. The Presidency and the power that goes with it is just the icing on the tip of the megalomaniac cake. Something he can point to and proclaim \"See how much they love me? I got 306 (actually 304) Electoral College Votes!\"  What other President registered for the next Presidential race on the day of inauguration?  Trump is just a banana  republic grade dictator dressed up in a shiny suit.  He has no clue what he's doing. If he did, we wouldn't be seeing this \"unpresidented\" chaos and push back.",
