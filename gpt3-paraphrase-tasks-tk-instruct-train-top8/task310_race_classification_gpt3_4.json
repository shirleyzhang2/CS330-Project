            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security. Allan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.

They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to.

The people are unfriendly, it's way too expensive, and the food is terrible - so why do so many tourists flock   there? London was named the world's most popular city between July and September 2013. It _ other world-famous cities such as New York and Paris, welcoming 4.9 million visitors, according to the UK Office for National Statistics. Amazingly, this was an increase of almost 19.5 percent on 2012 - the year when the Olympics happened in summer. So can London's success be explained? Well, maybe. As the English writer Samuel Johnson once said, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\". London life is often crazy and expensive, but if you can think of something, you can probably do it there. Anywhere in the city, you can often look around a great museum such as the British Museum, watch a concert at a historic venue   like the Royal Albert Hall, or dance the night away in a cool nightclub such as Fabric. And it's not just about culture - there are also world-famous sporting venues around the city. Many tourists like to watch soccer matches at stadiums such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, or Tottenham's White Hart Lane. Tourists even came to watch British tennis player Andy Murray's famous victory at the Wimbledon tennis tournament   in 2013. Yes, but what about the food? Well, even if you don't like British food - and if you've never had real fish and chips, or a summer pudding, then perhaps you should wait until you've tried them - there is plenty of great food from all over the world available in London's many restaurants. London, like many of its buildings, has a long history, but also never lacks a vibrant pulse  . All over the city, history and modernity come together to make it an essential place for tourists to discover. \n Question: What is the author's main purpose in writing the article? \n Options: (A) To show the effects of the 2012 London Olympics. (B) To analyze why London appeals to tourists. (C) To compare London with other world-famous cities. (D) To talk about common problems in London. \n Asnwer: A",

            "input": "Article: As the new semester begins, millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper or, more likely, how best to delay that paper. Procrastination is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it. They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space, eating snacks, surfing the Internet, watching videos and looking at other students sitting around them, who, most likely, are doing nothing either. Paralyzed   by their habit to procrastinate, they write micro blogs about their fears, asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue. But this does nothing to break the spell  . According to a recent report, 95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are always procrastinating. The figures are disappointing. Procrastinators are less wealthy, less healthy and less happy than those who don't delay. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior, but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong. Many procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure. Pelling says this is nonsense, as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. The behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel ashamed, inconveniences others and annoys loved ones. Pelling also points out that procrastination feels particularly delinquent  in a society that thinks of speedy action as admirable, and, at times, even as a moral good. Fortunately, social scientists have thrown their weight behind efforts to understand this behavioral mistake and offer strategies to control it. Piers Steel, a Canadian social scientist and author of The Procrastination Equation, believes human is \"designed\" to procrastinate. Nevertheless, he suggests a couple of good ways to get through the task at hand. \n Question: Which behavior belongs to procrastination? \n Options: (A) Never dream away the time. (B) Always complete the tasks ahead of time. (C) Never put off till tomorrow what should be done today. (D) Always wait to work until the \"good mood\" or \"good time\". \n Asnwer: D",

Before the trip, I'd had my car fixed. When the office employee of the garage was writing up the bill,she noticed my Louisiana license plate. \"You from New Orleans?\"she asked I said I was, \"No charge.\"She said, and firmly shook her head when I reached for my wallet. The next day I went for a haircut, and the same thing happened. As my wife was studying in Florida, we decided to move there and tried to find a rental house that we could afford while also paying off a mortgage (> on our mined house. We looked at many places, but none was satisfactory. We'd began to accept that we*d have to live in extremely reduced circumstances for a while, when I got a very curious e-mail from a James Kemmedy in California. He'd read some pieces I'd written about our sufferings for State, the online magazine  and wanted to give us (\"\"no conditions attached')a new house across thelake from New Orleans. It sounded too good to be true, but I replied, thanking him for his exceptional generosity, that we had no plan to go back. Then a poet at the University of Florida offered to let his house to me, while he went to England on his one-year paid leave. The rent was rather reasonable. I mentioned the poet's offer to James Kemdedy, and the next day he sent a check covering our entire rent for eight months.

During his lifetime Ellington turned musical sounds into many compositions, mostly in the style known as jazz. The Early Years Edward Kennedy Ellington was born in 1899 in Washington, D. C. It wasn't until Ellington was a teenager that his interest in music grew. He taught himself to play the piano by listening to local piano players. Sometime around 1916 Ellington began playing the piano at high school parties. Ellington realized that he enjoyed entertaining people with his music. He soon became a very popular musician, playing at parties and other events in the Washington area. Young adults seemed especially delighted by the modern pieces he composed. Success in New York In 1923, when Ellington was almost 24 years old, he joined The Washingtonians, a five-piece group of musicians in Washington, and became the group's leader in early 1924. In 1927 Ellington and his orchestra won an engagement at Harlem's famous Cotton Club. For the next three years, his orchestra played at the Cotton Club nearly every night. The Influence of the Cotton Club     Working at the Cotton Club encouraged Ellington's creativity. Since the shows changed every six months, he was challenged by the need to continually develop new material. He had to compose a wide variety of music to accompany the various acts in the Cotton Club shows and to adapt that music to the strengths and weaknesses of the players in his orchestra. By 1928 the popular nightspot began radio broadcasts. From the broadcasts Ellington and his orchestra gained a national reputation. On the Road As Ellington's popularity increased, he realized that his orchestra could do well on concert tours. They left the Cotton Club in 1931 and toured America and Europe almost continually for the next 43 years. In addition to touring, Ellington made recordings and continued to compose music. Duke Ellington played the piano, composed music, and led his famous orchestra for more than 50 years, until his death in 1974. Music lovers all over the world agree that the large quantity of music he created will be enjoyed for many years to come. \n Question: Which of the following can show us Ellington's leadership ability? \n Options: (A) Ellington was very popular at parties in the Washington area.

For example, my son is just like his father in many ways. We often say the two of them prove the proverb that the apple does not fall far from the tree. My daughter is very short. She would like to be taller. But I tell her that good things come  in small packages. Some valuable things are very small, like diamonds and other jewels. But I also tell my children that all that glitters is not gold. Something may look valuable, but may not really be valuable. Also, I tell them do not judge a book by its cover. You should not judge something only by its appearance. Sometimes I tell my children to cooperate to solve a problem. After all, two heads are better than one. But another proverb says too many cooks spoil the soup. If too many people try to do something, then the job will not be done well. I also tell my children that two wrongs do not make a right. You should not do something bad just because someone did the same to you. Some people are pessimists while other people are optimists. Pessimists always think about  how bad things are or will be; optimists might say that every cloud has a silver lining and they always look on the bright side. Other people are both pessimists and optimists. They hope for the best and prepare for the worst. Some people often worry about what they will do in a situation that might happen in the future. We could tell them do not cross that bridge until you come to it.

Karen Rodger, 41, welcomed her first pair of girls rowan and Isla after having twice given birth to twin boys. \"I still haven't really taken it on board because I was convinced I was having two boys,\" Rodger told Sky News. Karen said her husband Colin was equally stunned when the couple learned they were going to have their fifth and sixth child. \"He thought I was joking and immediately wrote back to say 'this is not funny'. I had to explain that it really was true,\" Karen said. The average couple has about a 3 percent chance of having twins when not accounting for fertility drugs. And with each following pregnancy, the changes of producing twins a second, or even third time, become less. Karen, a dance lecturer, first learned of the incredibly rare occurrence during a visit to her doctor and immediately texted her husband to share the news. \"I just could not believe it. It never crossed my mind that it would be twins again. I just thought that wouldn't happen to people like me, but I'm  ly delighted,\" she said. It had been several years since the couple's last children were born. Their oldest twins are 14 and the second set was born just two years later. \"I turned 40 and I thought, if I'm going to do it, I should do it now,\" Karen said. \"I spoken to my husband and we both thought we'd quite like another one so that was it and, one month later, I was pregnant.\"  Colin says the age and gender difference will ensure a sweat-inducing dilemma for any future suitors of the twin girls. It will be a frightening challenge for any boyfriend. \n Question: From Karen 's reaction to the news given by her doctor, we infer that  _  . \n Options: (A) she didn't know she was pregnant again (B) she was happy to have twins again (C) she didn't think she was different from others (D) she didn't know how to tell her husband the news \n Asnwer: D",
