        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms.

They're so racist they're willing to collude with foreigners to damage the United States. They're disgusting traitors. The Republican party is the conduit by which Putin has been able to attack our free society. Republicans want to get rid of his investigation. Mueller will expose Republicans' treason.",
