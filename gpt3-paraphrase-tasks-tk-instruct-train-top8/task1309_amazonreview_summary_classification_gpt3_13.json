Worked ok at first, but now the last 3 weeks, the cord only works intermittently.

Also, I find that the roller rail isn't very steady, so when using auto pan function it jitter left and right making the shot unusable, if no pan, just side way it is fine, but still little jitter. Overall I'm not too happy with this, so when it works, it works. It's more of a design flaw. The built quality is very good, and slider part is very smooth, but the bad thing was the roller wheel. Also I don't like the fact that you have a remote hanging around, it would be much cleaner if the control was built on the side of the slider. Wish I could just get my money back because I don't use it anyway because of the flaws. \n Summary: The product itself is decent but it arrived completely empty ...",
