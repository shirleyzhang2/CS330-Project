I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I filled it with black bendable straws, which looks classic for my style. Husband loves the bendable straws and displays an expression identifiable from childhood everytime he grabs one. We seriously adore this item based on function, durability and appearance. A few reviews complain about the base of the stainless holder not holding straws correctly BUT we don\u2019t have any issues at all!! You lift the lid, grab a straw and close the lit, period. When you fill the holder, just make sure the straws are seated in the straw base as you fill it to capacity, it\u2019s not a challenging process!!. Maybe I just don\u2019t understand or experience the issue noted by a few, but that\u2019s me. If I needed an additional straw dispensers, I\u2019d purchase again. Outstanding!!",

Got a lot of cleaning supplies with the protector which was nice, and the packaging the hold the screen protector was very sturdy and secure. The ease of installing was very simple. Steps are clearly labeled and easy to follow. Screen fit perfectly around the home button and corners. No excess so didn't have an issue with the screen peeling up when pulling it in and out of my bag. Screen sensitivity doesn't get affected at all, it actually requires less pressure now than without it. I will suggest this to any one who is in need of a great screen protector.",

They all had these chairs except my son and grandson. Needless to say they will have them for the next trip! Very packable and lightweight.",
