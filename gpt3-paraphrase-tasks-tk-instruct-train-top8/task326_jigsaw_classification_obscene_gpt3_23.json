        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: obscene and non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

That's correct.  That's the true account in military reports.\n\nOne veteran of Medusa on CBC Radio yesterday also told of the Command failure.\n\nSajjan got credit for his \"groundbreaking intelligence work\" while unbiased spectators are telling us the intelligence was totally useless, leading our troops to be virtually ambushed.\n\nI don't think this Prime Minister or his Ministers have even a passing familiarity with the truth.\n\nAnd now they are setting up our military for further failure with no equipment and budget cuts - which appears to have been the Liberal's goal all along.\n\nBut go ahead - Blame Harper.  \nLiberal Cads !",
