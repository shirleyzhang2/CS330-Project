These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

Even at the lowest resolution setting the refresh rate of the video is about every three seconds. It's very fiddly to get the picture to focus and having to weight a few seconds after each adjustment makes for a very long and frustrating process. If you increase the resolution of the picture the refresh rate lengthens exponentially. I'm guessing that every previous reviewer was paid by the company to write each glowing review. I disagree totally with all of them. I returning this cheap chinese junk. \n Polarity: negative",
