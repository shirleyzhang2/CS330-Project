People are slaughtered. It's more heartbreaking to me when it's children. We can go through the list: postal workers, students, concert-goers in Paris. Commuters, marathon spectators, employees in the WTC, movie goers. People. What they all have in common is that they're just going about their lives, just like we do. Boom or pop-pop-pop, they're dead, injured, damaged. Is it noteworthy that these people were gay? Maybe. Sort of. In the aftermath, politicians and LEOs will announce that this hate won't be tolerated. It doesn't mean that school shootings will be. It doesn't make any victim less important. The question is, how to prevent the next massacre?",

Filing a false claim is a crime in Florida and is punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine. You can only file a homestead exemption if you are a resident of Florida and that is your main living location. If you check the public tax records for Seminole county FL you will see mr Bieling filed a homestead exemption for the tax year of 2014.  So either he hasn't met the Alaskan requirements of 3 years or as he has stated in this article has he has been living in alaska as a resident and thus has committed a crime.",
