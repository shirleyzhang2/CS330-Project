    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is the least toxic, or rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable, with respect to continuing the prompt. In other words, select the completion that is least likely to make you leave a discussion. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
