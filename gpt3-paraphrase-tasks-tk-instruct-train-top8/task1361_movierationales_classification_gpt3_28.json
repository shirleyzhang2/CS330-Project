union labor and taking on most of the film 's responsibilities himself .\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role .\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x - rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme :\nhe coined the phrases \" rated x by an all - white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .\nhe also printed the phrase on tee - shirts which he had no problem selling .\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple .\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex .\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they 're bringing in suspects on a politically - charged case involving murder .\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu - mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously .\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death .\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles ' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back - street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .\nvan peebles ' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . .\n\"\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .\nof course , with today 's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner - city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" does n't seem all that revolutionary .\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles ' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass .\n\"\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big .\n\" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .\n\" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers .\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african - american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies .\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .\nstill others point to the clich ?\nblack potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" can not be made without conflicting points of view .\nit is a revolutionary movie\nnot because it 's about one man 's defiance , but because it put front - and - center black issues that had never been dealt with before .\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) .\nvan peebles tells an interesting story\nthat goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it .\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die .\ndo n't let them kill him .\nlet him die on his own .\n\"\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african - american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she could n't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message :\n\" watch out !\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues .\n\" beyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .\nhe shot in rough , documentary - like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him .\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty - five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite .\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film .\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect .\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african - american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .",

            "input": "there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong - worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac 's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying .\nit 's confounding .\ni ca n't believe a film can be this bad .\nand yet , it 's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in\na performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human .\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he does n't want to kill himself .\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors do n't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it 's good to help people .\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti - male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .\nso patch decides that he 's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i would n't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for\n( i actually liked potter 's performance , even if she is wasted ) .\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution .\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus .\nwe do n't know patch yet , but there 's sad music , and it 's supposed to make us really sad that he 's sad .\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! )\n, the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .\nreal drama is character - based .\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it .\nwe do n't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he 's simply a vehicle for patch 's greatness .\nreal drama does n't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry .\nthat 's why patch adams is not real drama .\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman 's sickening musical score .\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad .\nbut it 's not as bad as half - baked , simplistic themes .\nyou see , patch is a really great student .\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he 's cheating .\nbut patch does n't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .\n\"\nwhy do n't we see patients until the third year ?\n\"\nhe bursts out every three seconds .\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients .\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .\nmost of us have to study .\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but does n't know a toe from a finger , probably wo n't be too successful in preventing death .\noh wait\n, i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life !\n\" yes !\nthat is true !\nand you can not do that without studying .\nyou can not do that without going to medical school .\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .\nfollow the rules ?\nbah ! who needs the rules !\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules .\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .\nand then there 's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic .\na free clinic .\nin the middle of the forest .\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . for free .\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ?\nwill it have an emergency room ?\nor is it just for mental patients ?\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ?\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch 's motives ( i think another character asks him how he 's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly do n't explore or challenge patch 's ideas to any meaningful extent .\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .\ni know nothing about him .\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting .\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting .\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .\ni wo n't tell you that you ca n't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words .\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all .",
