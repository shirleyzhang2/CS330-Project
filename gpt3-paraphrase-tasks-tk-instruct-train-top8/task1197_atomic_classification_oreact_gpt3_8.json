        "In this task, you are given a tuple of two events, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants.

You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY, or others, feel what is mentioned in the Tail. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
