These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I have other bulbs in similar conditions which have lasted many years. I am disappointed in the short life of these. I have adjusted my overall rating down because of this problem. Original Review: These does exactly what I want them to do: they turn off in daylight, and on in darkness. I was skeptical because when I opened the package and looked at the bulbs, I could not find a photo sensor \u2026 so I expected these to stay on all the time, contrary to the claim. But, even though I couldn't find the photo sensor, it must be there. These do indeed turn on at night and off in the morning. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were described as \"cool white\". I'd describe them as \"blue-white\". (I'll take some of the blame for this, though, because the description did say 6000K, and I didn't pay enough attention to that. I wish I'd gotten the 3000K version.) In the end, these do the job they say they'll do. \n Rating: 2",
