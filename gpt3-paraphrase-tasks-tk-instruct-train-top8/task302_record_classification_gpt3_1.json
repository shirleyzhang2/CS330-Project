Nokia is attempting to woo app developers with such incentives as pre-installing their software on the forthcoming phone, prominent promotion for their products and funding development of an app, according to three people involved in the negotiations. A vibrant app store has become a major selling point to smartphone customers. In the past, Nokia, which sells the highest volume of mobile phones worldwide, has made efforts to work with some creators of apps for its platforms. A Nokia spokeswoman said the company offers app developers a variety of incentives, some in partnership with Microsoft, which include coding assistance and marketing. \"We do not disclose these arrangements, as each is different,\" she said. Microsoft declined to comment for this story.Nokia is offering to pay developers to make apps for its new phone, sources saySuch payments from phone manufacturers are unusualMicrosoft did something similar last year, but its Windows Phone app catalog is still lackingNokia is set to launch its first Windows phone by the end of the year, sources say \n Questions:On Tuesday, Microsoft began distributing the new version of Windows Phone, which will run on the _ device.
