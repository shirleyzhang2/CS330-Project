Only simple people think there are simple answers to social questions. In fact, assuming that such answers exist is typically a component of white privilege. \n\nBut white supremos also need a firm hand, since they are heavily armed, glorify war, and espouse violence, and worse, against Jews and people of color, which is illegal and dangerous.  This is why the AntiFa should cease trying to kick their butts and instead shame them through outing on FB, Instagram and in the press and such. Hold them up for the losers they are and they'll vanish.\n\nYou're not asking not a simple question. Both groups--the destitute and the white nationalists--need justice to be done. Own it: you despise the poor, favor the white supremos over civil rights and equality, and you associate being on the right side of history with the supposed moral quibbling of \"political correctness\".",
