        "You are given a short poem. Your task is to predict if the author is in elementary school or high school. Authors in grades 1-6 will be considered as in elementary school, and those in grades 7-12 will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. Each input will have at least one output, and it cannot have both categories at a time."
