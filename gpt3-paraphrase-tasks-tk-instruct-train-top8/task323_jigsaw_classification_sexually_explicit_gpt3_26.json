Indoctrination to make them believe they were born that way with no choice. This is the way democrats are sounding. This is what they continue to do as well. They are pointing fingers with so much hypocrisy it's almost as sick as forcing a person to take a pennetration in the assets just because you want to be gay and ensure others are forced to be this way to. Just accept it and ignore the CDC talking about the aids epidemic sweeping the nation because of the last 8 years. Maybe we should ignore it and let them do this. Once they die off from sexually transmitted flagrant perversions/  they get what they paid for. \nHomosexuality is (Not love) it's just about having sex. If God is love, Love is not gay sex. \nLove is putting others before yourself. This includes having sex. Real love is not sex(rapeor homosexual tendencies.",

He seems earnest and certainly this is a welcome exploration of the Trump phenomenon from a thoughtful source.\nToo bad no one has done a similar tome on the Obama presidency and the disasters it wrought. We could never expect this from a centrist Democrat, like Joe Manchin. The left is marching in lockstep and none of them would dare speak their minds.\nThis is a shame because in large part the Trump presidency is a Republican knee-jerk reaction to the calamity of Obama's eight years of malfeasance.",
