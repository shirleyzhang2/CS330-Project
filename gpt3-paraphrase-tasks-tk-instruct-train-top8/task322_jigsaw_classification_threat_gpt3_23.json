The cheap black market crap is still coming up from Mexican nationals, and the good stuff from BC and Humbolt.  The I5 corridor is still just as busy, and they are still making a ton of money. Nothing has really changed except that the legal market has made it easy for anyone of legal age to buy it.  And the legal market is controlled by corporate growers with million dollar facilities, or a co-op of smaller growers. The Federal government \"war on drugs\" really has no impact on the legal market in Oregon. I don't see any glutton of weed, whatever that means.",

He's like a trainable dog.  The only thing in his life that looks like success to him was pandering to a bunch of morons who watched his \"reality\" show because it gave him the \"love and adoration\" his twisted little mind and psyche need so desperately.  And these days he keeps going back to \"the big reveal\" like it's something normal adults do on a daily basis.\n\nI can just see this pitiful excuse for a human being after this national nightmare is over.  Sitting in his horrid, gilded monstrosity of an apartment, muttering to himself, \"I did it.  I won it all.\"   All the while the rest of us has to live in a world where someone this sad, mean and stupid could become president of the United States.",
