I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

There's always some slutty girl in these types of movies trying to seduce someone, except this one is not a looker and sounds like a ditz. No one would have stayed in this house for another minute unless you have a mental disorder. I was finally waiting for a twist, too, since I knew this couldn't just be it. Then the twist comes, and you're like wtf? That's it? I feel like this movie could have been done better if it was done by the creators of Black Mirror. I was on a streak of good films on Amazon until I just watched this one. Don't waste your time. \n Category: toy",

I know his name but there were so MANY names, I'm not really sure who he was or how he fit into the story. There were dozens of names of people connected to the story. To complicate matters even more, sometimes they were called by their first name and sometimes they were called by their last name. I had a very hard time remembering who was who and what part they played in the story. In the end I just gave up on trying to keep every name, first and last, straight. The author wrote this book like it was a novel with imagined conversations, thoughts, and movements. It was enough to make a real true crime buff crazy! It all sounded so fake and made up! With a complexity of characters and the imagined conversations it was just not a fun book to read. Also, there was NOTHING about the trials other than the results. Had this been my first true crime book, I probably would have never read another one. I have read hundreds and this was one of the worst. Friends often want me to recommend a \"good true crime book\" to them. This will NOT be one of my recommendations! There was nothing about it that I enjoyed. No good! \n Category: digital_ebook_purchase",
