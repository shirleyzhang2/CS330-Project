        "You will be given a sentence. If the sentence is a general piece of advice, output \"yes\". Otherwise, output \"no\". Advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in various forms, such as Direct and Indirect advice. (1) Direct advice is explicit, using words or questions that suggest or recommend an action. (2) Indirect advice is more subtle, hinting at an action through personal experiences or statements that imply an action should or should not be taken."
