These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

            "input": "Review: There were a couple of mistakes in the story line. I almost stopped reading because right in the beginning it did not make sense to me that a character had a gun and was holding it to his head and then nothing happened about his apparent attempted suicide. Later, a phone apparently woke someone up, but then in the same paragraph the phone was dead. So I think it was supposed to say that maybe the phone dropped on the floor and woke the person up? But putting that aside, it was a very good original story. I like the main character and it was fast-moving and interesting. The only other thing that made me leave a star off, is that it was rather short and didn't really have an ending, you have to read the second book to find out what happens. I do recommend this, if you're willing to grab the second book too. \n Rating: 3",

However, as many other reviewers here I have had the same issue where the first few times I used it the battery lasted a long time. Now, it will only epilate for a few minutes before I have to put it back on the charger. Unfortunately, you cannot use this epilator while it is plugged into the charger, so it is kind of frustrating that you can't just power through and get the epilating over with in one sitting. With that being said, it does a really good job of actually epilating. My leg hairs grow quickly, so I have to epilate once every 2 weeks. This has been an okay first epilator, but honestly if I could send this one back I would. I will probably buy one in the future that will work while it's plugged in so I don't have to wait in between charges to use it. If you are looking at purchasing this epilator, please look into other epilators that will actually work while charging. Don't make the same mistake I did! \n Rating: 3",
