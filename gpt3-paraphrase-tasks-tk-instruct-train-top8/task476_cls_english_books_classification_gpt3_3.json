            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!",

First, I must say that the previous reviewer shuns the author's decision to include other books as recommended reading, yet I find that when an author does this, they are helping the reader truly expand on the subject, and it shows that the author is secure enough to not feel that their way is the only way.  This book has been THE most helpful book for me to learn the Tarot, and about myself and friends/family.  There's a bit of numerology in it, and some lessons that are fun to do, at the same time, these teach more about the cards.  I would recommend this book to novices and skilled alike",

A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a \"key\" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's \"will\" and race as the key to a \"kultur's\" success.     This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.

As other reviewers have noted, by the end of this edition, the author's leftist political views and anti-Catholic epistemological perspective overwhelm the narrative to the point that credibility suffers.  This is really rather sad, as Levenda is a talented writer, who has done, evidently, some significant research.  Unfortunately, it becomes hard to take an author seriously who quite rightly attacks the Bush clan, whilst holding the hideous Clintons above reproach, and worse, misses no opportunity to villify the Church, while smiling at Wicca.  The hypocricy is really breathtaking.    Understand that, in the corpus of this text, there is much that is worthwhile, certainly entertaining, and well presented.  It is simply that the dictates of scrupulosity and exactitude cry out for better balance.    This volume ends, as did the last, not with a bang, but with a whimper.  In fact, Levenda's last paragraph is, in its entirety, a quote from \"The Book of Ceremonial Magic\", of all things.  We are left wondering as to the efficacy of picking up the next volume in the series.  There is much else that cries out to be read.  We may read the next in volume, if only in the hope that some sense of balance can be restored.  But this may be another example of the triumph of hope over experience.",
