        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head can be characterized by being or having the Tail or not. Being characterized usually describes entities' general characteristics such as rose is red, or subjective attributes such as thirst is uncomfortable. It can also map to descriptors that speak to the substance or value of items such as meat has the property of being stored in the freezer or bike is powered by a person's legs. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
