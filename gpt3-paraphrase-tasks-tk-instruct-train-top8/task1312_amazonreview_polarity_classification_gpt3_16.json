I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product. Because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, it's a negative review."

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

There's a small mirror inside, which is handy, two pockets for cards, and a slot where you can put in bank notes, cash, receipts, memos, etc. I never had a screen protector, and now I probably never will because of how the case naturally keeps it covered when closed. I also appreciate the fact that I can set it on the side and the case will help it stand hands-free.",

I didn't realize that every time Nintendo released a version of firmware that this controller would also have to be upgrade (if it even has one) in order to work with it. - The controller doesn't have the gyro/motion function that the Pro Controllers do.

I can feel a breeze around my bare feet from across the room from the unit's fan, so it seems to cover a lot of space.. It has a nice quiet sound to it, a little bit white noise. Certainly fine in a bedroom unless you are quite sensitive. I was surprised at the size of the unit (because I don't read descriptions), but found a place for it pretty easily. Looking forward to getting another for a room across the house but woah expensive, even on sale.",

Color looked good. Unfortunately, upon opening the box, I found a rod that was completely snapped off, the crank casing had some stress areas and the sticker on the crank was damaged and falling off... I couldn't even bother trying to open it up to see the fabric or make a comment on that. I contacted the company directly as requesting on the paper insert so we'll see how the customer service is... One star for now... Maybe more later?",
