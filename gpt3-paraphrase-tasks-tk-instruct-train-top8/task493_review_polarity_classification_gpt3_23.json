First of all this book is not written for each state, so you will have to check on your own state or county laws along with this book. As for this book not helping you pass the \"TEST\". Responsible drivers know that their is much much more to driving then passing the \"TEST\", which this book goes into great detail letting its readers know. I've been A police officer for almost 9 years and now work at a school and deal with children all the time and a lot of thing seem boring to them. But we as adults must continue the teach, and hope that some of what they read sinks in. When dealing with driving a vehicle, learning by experience a lot of times ends up to late. This book doesn't teach you how to pass the \"TEST\" it teaches you how to be a better driver, something we all need to be...",

The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky.",

Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy.",

I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff.",

So many individuals in these communities were forced not to appear \"weak,\" and jumped on the neighborhood bandwagon to accuse, accuse, accuse.Nothing is more horrifying than the thought of our children being in peril...but that fear sadly caused a lot of irreversible damage to many innocent people's lives in these cases.From the Salem Witch trials to the Senator McCarthy insanity to this mess, it seems that every so often the civilized world goes mad.
