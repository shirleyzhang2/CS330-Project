            "input": "the postman delivers but not first class the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman [ warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post - apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner .\neven worse , i thought that \" waterworld \" was watchable .\nread the following with those particular grains of salt . ]\nit 's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart .\ndue to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three - year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms .\nalthough this is the future , it looks like a western .\nas the film opens , kevin costner ( his character 's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company .\ngiving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders . running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) .\nthe rag - tag retro - futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the \" clan \" after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes .\ntaking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either .\nonce he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the \" restored congress of the united states of america \" .\nthis scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants .\nfood and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile .\nshortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item .\nalthough the postman knows he 's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids ' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second - in - command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through .\nthe revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists ' tyranny .\nthe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner .\nalthough the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted .\nit 's derivitive of costner 's own \" waterworld \" and clint eastwood westerns .\nthere 's little here that we have n't seen dozens of times before .\nthe film is often down - right corny .\na scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright - eyed child is embarrassing in its slow - motion banality .\nthe film 's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor .\ndespite the film 's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained .\nwhat was the war about ?\nhow did civilization change so rapidly ?\neveryone has horses : where did all they come from ? the \" law of eights \" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ? are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and has n't made their way west to help or conquer ?\nthere is some jumbled symbolism here that does n't appear to make sense .\nthe tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities .\nthe evil army is called \" holnists \" which sounds coincidentally like the new age \" holism \" , but why ? is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ?\nwhy is the general named \" bethlehem \" ?\nthere seems to be some reason for that , but what ?\nsometimes the movie feels like a joke .\nan army of postal workers armed with guns ?\nconsidering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys .\nit 's even more difficult to accept those re - powering the federal government as the heroes .\ngiven the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it 's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film 's nationalism .\neven with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have .\nit 's doubtful that \" the postman \" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time .\nbesides we 're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug .\n( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the \" michael redman \" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him .\nperhaps this similarly - named person should have used kevin costner 's postal service . )",

            "input": "sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to .\nit 's not the time or the distance , it 's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy .\nyet somehow , the movies are all well made\nand i always get caught up in the story .\nthe wings of the dove fits the pattern .\nkate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love .\nmerton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate .\nbut kate 's \" job \" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class .\nher father lost all of her family 's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man .\nnaturally , a newspaper writer 's wages do n't count as \" rich .\n\" kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he 's not marriageable .\nkate 's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice .\nat a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees .\nkate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her .\nit appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup .\nmerton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it .\nhe is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute .\nthe three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated .\nlet 's sum up : millie has fallen for merton .\nmerton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate .\nkate loves him but ca n't marry him , so on the one hand she 's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she 's jealous of them as a couple .\na clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact .\nat this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies .\nmillie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate .\nshe lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees .\nkate leaves venice so that the two m 's can be alone together .\nmerton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her .\nhe 's not sure he can separate the two .\nkate finds that she 's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else .\nthe brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved .\nwithout revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly .\nthe title refers to the object of merton 's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament .\none is left with feelings of regret and despair .\nwhat started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy .\nan interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir .\na couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after .\ntheir involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life - ruining mistake .\ni would n't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting .\nas i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but\ni liked the performances from roache and elliot .\nroache successfully conveyed his character 's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he 's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie .\nmillie 's part did n't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible .\ni will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low - traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion .\ntheir settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially .\nstill , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .",
