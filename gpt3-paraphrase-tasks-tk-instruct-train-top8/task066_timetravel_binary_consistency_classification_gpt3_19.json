        "Given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences, where the second sentence is missing, and a candidate for the second sentence, you need to identify if the given sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it connects, output \"Yes\", otherwise output \"No\". Do not generate anything else apart from \"Yes\" or \"No\". The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences form a consistent story."
