There is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that these acts were carried out by Jews, \"libruls\", Trump opponents or anyone except who they appear to have been done by: American Neo-Nazis. Yet the author starts with this screwball assumption, references the demented musings of our wannabe dictator, and then concludes that the victim is the perpetrator. \n\nIt is not impossible that the unlikely scenario that Stahl postulates is true. It has happened before. However, most prudent people would wait for at least a shred of supporting evidence to emerge before making such an outrageous claim.",
