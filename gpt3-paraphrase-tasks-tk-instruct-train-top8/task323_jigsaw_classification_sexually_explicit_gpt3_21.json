That means the Democrats are the minority because the working people of Alaska don't want to support freeloaders & unions.

An interesting exercise would be to compare his fact-based information compared to the spin that will be reported in the Adventist Review.\n\nWe look forward to more of his balanced reporting and analysis of the serious problems being created by the current administration in power at the GC.  It is with that hope that he will be reporting in 2020 when Wilson II will be replaced with someone who will undo the damage to the Adventist Church currently being caused by Wilson II and his supporters. \n\nWe can hope that a new GC president will resume the positive \ndevelopments that were slowly being implemented by the moderate GC president, Dr. Jon Paulsen.  Wilson II and his misguided policies will then be discarded into \"the dustbin of Adventist history.\"",
