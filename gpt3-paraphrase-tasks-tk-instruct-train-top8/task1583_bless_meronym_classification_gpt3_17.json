    "Definition": [
        "Given an object and a part, your task is to decide if the object has that part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts. You should indicate 1 if the object has the part, or 0 if the object does not have the part. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
