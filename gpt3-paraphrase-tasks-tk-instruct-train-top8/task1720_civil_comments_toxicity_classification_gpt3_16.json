Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

Should be a simple decision MOVE! \n\nSeems they are not interested in the fact that the majority of Alaskans want them out of the building and they are thumbing their upper crust noses at the very same people that put them in office.  \n\nThis is what happens when people do not care about who runs this place and sit watching TV or on Face book rather than taking the time to educate themselves on the issues and people that will run their lives\u2026 Oh and not to mention that voting is a major inconvenience to the busy lives of 60% of Alaskans.",

Why did they spend all the money to investigate a crime which in the very near future was going to be a non issue?  There is a liquor store down the road selling untold jugs every day.\n\nA reasonable person might think that in Bethel and the surrounding area, cops might have something better to do.
