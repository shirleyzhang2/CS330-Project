delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet ' n southern new girl in town .\nalthough the characters are only slightly connected ( i .\ne .\ncasey is delilah 's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both do n't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they are n't really even sure if they can trust one another .\n\"\nthe faculty \" is another smart and pop - culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90 's .\nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no - brainer .\nthe plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people 's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings - on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful\n.\nsurely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who were n't .\nthe epilogue was also a refreshing change - of - pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better .\nthe performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do .\none exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well - known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster .\nas members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role .\nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell .\nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence .\nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear .\nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million - dollar budget .\nalthough not one of the best horror or science - fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released .\nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really were n't human .\nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small - town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers .\n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters .\nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan 's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team .\nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving .",

it 's a bad film because it 's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation .\nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it 's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess .\nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world .\n12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we 're all living in a frank capra movie .\nmeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the \" movement \" which has apparently begun to grow .\npay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core\n.\nit 's as if director mimi leder did n't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film was n't \" gutsy \" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for .\nso the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being \" saved \" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though\nit seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself is n't quite sure if it 's ready to buy into its own utopian blather .\npay it forward offers \" crowd pleasing \" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr 's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson 's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive - talking \" black hoodlum with a heart of gold \" ( coming on the heals of the black , god - like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? .\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ?\n\" leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment .\n( maybe spike 's flick was n't so misguided after all ) .\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you 'll find yourself trapped in\nshould you not heed my warnings .\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience\n.\nit 's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns .\none scene in which a slightly de - glamed helen hunt ( de - glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim\n[ her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama ] , hunt 's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip .\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance .\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he 's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference .\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender .\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i 'm not making this up )\nshe scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol .\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow - ups\n; it 's all very theatrical , especially hunt 's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar .\npay it forward\nhas the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors should n't get academy awards .\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists .\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections .\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it 's as if we can make out the little munchkin 's thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" .\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only - in - the - movies children , a martyr - figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher .\nnever mind that the two could n't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller - ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary .\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap - ish cornball antics .\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self - sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life .\nthey 're so adorable .\nof course the blame ca n't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row .\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post - cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth 's possible demise by a crazed meteorite .\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ?\ns , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) .\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it 's a movie that treats earth 's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days .\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching .\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie is n't as na ?\nve as you might think \" she seems to be saying .\nno ,\nit 's just horribly confused .",
