            "input": "I wish people would understand that \"worshiping\" or following a deeply held religious faith, regardless of the sect, denomination, etc. is more than just what happens on Sunday morning from 11am-noon.  Religious faith and religious life is not a suit one wears one day in a week, and then one puts on a different suit for the remainder of the week. True faith affects a person's every action. It forms one's view of the world. Requiring Christians to help facilitate something their faith strongly condemns, e.g. baking a wedding cake, photographing a wedding, counseling a same-sex couple etc., is in the same vein as forcing a conscientious objector to go to war. We don't force C.O.'s into the Army, many of whom have religious objections; why do we force other people of faith to go against their religious objections? If the First Amendment is to be anything more than feel-good legislation, then people of faith must be allowed to live that faith every day-even if it isn't popular with others.",

You don't have to be a flaming Liberal to find Mr. Ralston's values, actions and comments offensive.  Springfield, from all I've seen and read over the last 20 years, has become a moderate, \"right-of-center\" business friendly, diverse community.

For a bunch of bureaucrats that have been doing lunch meetings for several years that they even voted on any thing is amazing. I would be interested to see the over head of this committee. In fact the editor is totally wrong if the interest is saving money. The maybe 6-8 million not going to fund draft registration after committee costs will be spent on some thing else. Like maybe send it to ltd for their next round of monument building and legacy padding emx. Draft  registration just might serve another purpose. Like about the only thing left that demonstrates to 18 year olds they may be called on to defend what freedoms we have left in this country. Just the opposite of what is taught in schools.",
