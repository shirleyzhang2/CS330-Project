You need to output 'good' if the sentence is a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. Output 'bad' if the sentence is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match, or if the sentence is not a grammatically correct instance of a sentence."
