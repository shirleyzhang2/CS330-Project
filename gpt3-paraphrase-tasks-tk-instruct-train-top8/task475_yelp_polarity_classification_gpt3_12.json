            "input": "No pros. What has happened to MGM Properties?\\nColor-cordinated duct tape does not a carpet repair make. In the parking garage, stacked, unwrapped mattresses and box springs from the remodel and what is certain is these, after being stored in an open-air environment, are re-used in the hotel rooms. Same for the furnishings. What else am I to think but; \\\"\"if they cut corners here, in this manner, where else?\\\"\" Do they scrape left-overs off patron's plates in the restaurants to make new plates for the next person? And these are just the first impressions you get upon driving/walking-into the hotel.\\n\\nAt check-in, you are immediately made to feel like you did something wrong or are a second-class citizen for ordering your room through LasVegas.com. And that assumption becomes stark reality upon entering your room. Dirt on the floor from previous tenants. A part of a clothing tag there, a red piece of lint there (I would look at that same lint on the bathroom floor every morning as I used the toilet meaning, it was never cleaned) a couple of pennies on the floor there. Things that a vacuum couldn't have missed which tells you that it hadn't been vacuumed. \\n\\nAn austerity and conservation program that asks you to sleep on dirty bed linens. However, you have the opportunity to request from housekeeping that the linens get changed every day, which we did. This did not go unpunished.\\n\\nOnly 2 towels for 2 people in the bath. No hand towels, no laundry bag, no stationery in the desk, no coffee-maker, no refrigerator and furniture that is stained so severely you are afraid to sit on it or worse, broken so you cannot utilize it.\\n\\nHair in the bathtub drain and a faucet in the tub that doesn't shut-off properly. You only have one option, full-on, but that doesn't matter for a shower because the shower head is so compromised that only a bare minimum of water can make its way to you and even that, in misdirected and errant streams. It's hard to even rinse the soap from your body. But you wouldn't know it because the lighting is so poor in the shower because, well, because there is no light.  The light must filter in from over the vanity but it can't because of two opaque shower curtains. Both are on the same hangers and do not permit leaving the exterior curtain open while you attempt to shower.\\n\\nAside from lacking common sense, this system, it seems, leaves the property owner open to severe liability should someone fall in the tub due to poor visibility.\\n\\nThe room does include an alarm clock that goes off automatically, every day, at 5AM. With no instruction on how to turn it off.\\nThe phone book is two years old, the TV is old, small and dirty. I have larger screens in my vehicles. It would have been funny but it wasn't.\\n\\nNo working vent in the bath so the mirrors fog up and reveal the hap hazard streaks and wipe marks of the very poor cleaning that seems never to include the far end of the mirror.\\n\\nThe curtains are tattered and the air-conditioner window unit is so poorly designed and placed that it blows open the drapes to create a flickering light should you decide to try and sleep in the daylight hours. The noise is absurd and the unit must cycle on every 5 minutes in an effort to maintain a 69 temp even on a mild 85 day.\\n\\nWe requested more towels the first day and they were promised but never arrived. We again requested more towels the second day (at 8:30 AM) but were told that house keeping didn't arrive until 9AM so our showers would have to wait. At 9:30 we called back and were told \\\"\"I just got in, I don't know, I will run your order through again.\\\"\" Whatever that means. Can I assume that just got in means 30 minutes ago and I don't know means the order was never received? No. Because the man on the phone seemed to know what the order was without me ever telling him. Clearly he had received the order. So we waited and waited and waited. We should be enjoying our holiday, out and about and spending money at the tables. That seems like a good business model to me. But no. We wait instead for towels that never come.\\n\\nWhen we finally complain loudly and long enough we get upgraded to another, in another tower and are offered no help in moving our things. So we pack and move ourselves (again, when we should be out enjoying our holiday) and when we get there our \\\"\"upgrade\\\"\" is, in many ways, worse than the previous room. No hangers. So we call housekeeping and request some and are promised they will be delivered right up to us. That's at noon. We call back at 2. No answer. Try to call the front desk. No answer. Call the operator and ask to speak with the manager. We get a supervisor instead. He promises hangers. At 4pm we call back, still no hangers. I told him our clothes, which we had to pack and move ourselves, are now wrinkled and we have a dinner date. He suggests I use the iron. May I suggest he be sent to class to learn what customer service is?\\n\\nI could go on & on but no room!",

            "input": "Came here and sat at the sushi bar alone, better than not coming at all. :) I ordered the tasting menu. They gave me a choice of $125 or $175. I figured go big or go home so I got the more expensive. All of the cold courses were amazing. Just what you would expect. The standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar. After that were sashimi and sushi which included no salmon (they asked what I liked in the beginning and I said salmon) and I was suprised they didn't give me any. Then came the prepared food. Scallop really good. Wagu beef melt in your mouth but very fatty and greasy. Would not get again and the beef was why I paid the $50 more. There was a cold noodle dish as last course before dessert that was boring and forgettable. Dessert was good. I had to order sashimi salmon and pay separately which was $ and unfair in my opinion seeing as I was sitting at sushi bar and voiced that I liked salmon. If I did it again I would get the $125 menu and skip the wagu and be more vocal that I wanted salmon when they brought my sushi/sashimi course. Overall, amazing sushi. That's why you go to Nobu anyway so stick with that and you won't regret it. Spent $280 for myself!!! Very $",

We had regular tickets but when we arrived with the bride dressed in her bachelorette gear we were upgraded to VIP seats. We sat front row center! The host was very nice. The woman who opened the show was a local comedian and she was hilarious. At that moment we realized why we were front row center- so she could rip apart the bride- awesome!! There were three other comics performing and they were all very very funny. We laughed the entire time. The drinks were good, not watered down. I have no clue how much they cost because we were all beyond a little tipsy! The club was very clean and classy looking. After the show was over the comedians were all in the lobby. We got to meet them all, talk with them, take pictures and get autographs. It made for a very fun night and I will be returning with my husband. We would also take visiting friends and family here. I will say that the tickets were a little pricey for the Tropicana, but I did feel like I got my moneys worth.",

Most other private acting schools operating in the state of Arizona, are about making money. Some of them won't even tell you they're a school. They promote themselves as, \\\"\"middlemen\\\"\" between the actor and the agent. Additionally, they target their marketing toward parents with hopeful children. Why? Because they are about making money. Verve Studio is definitely the antithesis. The courses of study offered here, are for the serious performer.",

It should be considered...\\\"\"This will change your life and will slap you like the doctor did to your butt the day you were born\\\"\" good food.  I have YET to purchase ANYTHING from The Lodge menu that I didn't LOVE.  I recently just had something from there breakfast menu....the Breakfast burger(I think that is the name).  Holy hell!!!  Cooked to order clean beef, over Texas toast,  smothered in with melting cheddar cheese, with an over easy egg on top.  If i had a hangover, this would have been the cure...instead...I just REALLY enjoyed this Perfect burger.  I have been to the Lodge COUNTLESS times.  The service is ALWAYS GREAT!!  the Happy Hour specials are ALWAYS perfect.  (The Wings....THE Wings...THE WINGS!!!!!!!)  OH.....and they have this dipping sauce for your Sweet Potato Fries that will LITERALLY make you wanna slap your momma!!  I need a straw with it...and I am happy.  Overall...the Lodge is the PERFECT Place.  The Beer is always cold.  The Tv's are always clear.  The Cornhole bags are always open to play..and life is just easier there.  With all the  Scottsdale Douche Bag Bars popping up left and right........the Lodge stays close to their Roots.  VERY NON-DOUCHE BAG FEEL...at least during the week and before 10pm on the weekends  =)  I love this place.  It is my \\\"\"Security Blanket.\\\"\"\\n\\nGo there and tell them....Mike DLT sent you  =)",

There is no passion here. Service is not attentive and the food is just not very good. Onion rings were good. This place needs to take a look around and see why their neighbors are always busy and they are not. It became evident to us tonight.",
