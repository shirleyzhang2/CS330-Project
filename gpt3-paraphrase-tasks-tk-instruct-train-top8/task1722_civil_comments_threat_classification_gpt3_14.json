There are important journalistic questions, too... \n\nDo not use derogatory terms, such as insane, crazy/crazed, nuts or deranged, unless they are part of a quotation that is essential to the story....\n\n Avoid descriptions that connote pity, such as afflicted with, suffers from or victim of. Rather, he has obsessive-compulsive disorder....\n\nAvoid using mental health terms to describe non-health issues. Don\u2019t say that an awards show, for example, was schizophrenic. \n   \n Use the term mental or psychiatric hospital, not asylum. \n\n http://www.ap.org/content/press-release/2013/entry-on-mental-illness-is-added-to-ap-stylebook",

I do however think that insulting people that disagree only ensures that they will not change their opinion.  I believe that most people that want laws designed to protect people from themselves have only good intentions.  In my opinion most of these types of laws look great on paper, just not in practice.\n\nI live with chronic pain, I choose not to take pain medications because it would effect my work.  I am happy with my choice because its the right choice for me.  If the consequences of a persons choices don't have direct impact on my life, it should be none of my business what they do.  This doesn't mean I shouldn't share my concern for the person, just that I shouldn't be empowered to coerce their decision making.\n\nI also think that a doctor/pharmacy shouldn't ever be forced to write/fill a prescription they don't feel comfortable with.",
