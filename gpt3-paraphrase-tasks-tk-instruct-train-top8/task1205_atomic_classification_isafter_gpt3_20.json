    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You need to determine whether the Head happens after the Tail or not, and output \"Yes\" or \"No\" accordingly. The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
