    "Definition": [
        "Given a tweet in English, you are expected to output 'sarcastic' or 'non-sarcastic' depending on whether the tweet is sarcastic or not. A sarcastic sentence is one that uses words that mean the opposite of what the speaker really wants to say, either to insult someone, show irritation, or for comedic effect."
