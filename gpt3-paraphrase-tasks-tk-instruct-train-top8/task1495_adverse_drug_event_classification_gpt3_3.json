        "The task is to classify whether a medical case report extracted from MEDLINE mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. Adverse drug reactions are reactions that are appreciably harmful or unpleasant, resulting from the use of medical products. These reactions predict hazard from future administration of the product and warrant prevention or specific treatment, or alteration of the dosage regimen, or withdrawal of the product."
