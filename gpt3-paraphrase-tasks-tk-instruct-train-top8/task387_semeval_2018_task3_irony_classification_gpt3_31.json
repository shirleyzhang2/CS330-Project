        "In this task, you are given a tweet. The tweet contains irony. You must classify the type of irony in the tweet. There are three types of irony: polarity, situational, and other. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Other kinds of irony are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
