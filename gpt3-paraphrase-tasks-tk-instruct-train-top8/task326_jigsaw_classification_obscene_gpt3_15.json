They're not mutually exclusive. The fact he didn't for three days speaks volumes about his own personal beliefs.",

Impregnating local hobos is no different than allowing in hobos aka uneducated & unskilled immigrants from Mexico. Take care of the hobos in your own backyard before worrying about hobos from other countries. Just look at Hawaii with almost 33% of the population under the federal poverty levels. I'm sure you can find plenty of 20+ year old Mandans that are looking for a 70+ year old sugar daddy to raise children with. Now go out there and open your wallet wide and you'll attract plenty of millennials right out of the woodwork.",
