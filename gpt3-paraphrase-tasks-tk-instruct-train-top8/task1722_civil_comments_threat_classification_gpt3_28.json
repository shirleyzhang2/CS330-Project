Ten Democrats took donations from Knight during the last few weeks of the last election: Peter Courtney, Chris Harker, Jennifer Williamson, Jenny Burdick, Jeff Barker, Jules Bailey, Arnie Roblan, Chris Garrett, Mark Hass and Val Hoyle. Looks like they all voted \u201cyes\u201d on extending Nike\u2019s tax breaks. Only five Dems voted \u201cno\u201d\"\n\nClearly she is well-liked by conservative billionaires.
