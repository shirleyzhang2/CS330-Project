        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. You need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output 'No'. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent."
