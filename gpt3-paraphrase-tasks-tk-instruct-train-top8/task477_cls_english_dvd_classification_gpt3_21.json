As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",

            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

As far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment.  The acting was good but Robin Williams did not receive as much screen time as Ewen McGreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been.  But the major problem was the story.  Yes, it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak, boring at times and just silly.  I would recommend Ice Age or Garfiled: The Movie rather than this film",

            "input": "On the Edge of the Abyss . For thirteen tense days in October, 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union teetered on the brink of nuclear war.  The Soviets had placed intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba.  These missiles were capable of striking much of the United States and Latin America.  Alerted to the presence of the missiles by a U-2 spy plane photograph, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp) and the joint chiefs of staff begin to chart a course to avoid a catastrophic nuclear war.    The movie is told through the eyes of Presidential aide Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner).  Aside from Costner's obviously fake Bostonian accent, the design works quite well.  By telling the story through O'Donnell's eyes, it allows the viewer to focus more on JFK, RFK, and the development of the crisis.      Directed by Costner as well, the movie describes the entire crisis, from start to finish. From the first discovery of the missiles by the U-2, through the agonizingly long two weeks of decisions and negotiations, to the final outcome, this movie covers all the bases.  I do wish that more attention would have been paid to the Soviet side of the crisis.  I believe that the film would have been more complete had this occurred.    The acting throughout the film is excellent.  Bruce Greenwood gives a compelling and exciting performance as John F. Kennedy, while Steven Culp is equally as good as JFK's younger brother Bobby.  Costner himself is again at his best as O'Donnell, and Michael Fairman does a wonderful job as the embattled Adlai Stevenson, who stands up to the Soviets at the U.N. with his famous \"hell freezes over\" quote.    I give this movie my highest recommendation. October, 1962 was a tense time for the world, and this great movie does a fine job of depicting the missile crisis.  As with its earlier predecessor \"The Missiles of October\", this film describes exactly how close the world came to nuclear war.",

            "input": "Good compilation of live show, with Promo footage to boot . The Anthology is a very good collection of 3 live shows from Bruce Dickinson's, pulled from many sources.  DVD ONE has Tattoo Millionaire tour live footage (DIVE DIVE DIVE), and Skunkworks Live. The DIVE video is poor quality shots, and the sound is not the greatest.  My favorite is the Skunkworks footage.  That album was probably the best of his first three solo albums in terms of musicianship and variation from maiden.  It's good to the footage done when it was still fresh, and laugh at Bruce trying to be \"alternative\".     Disc two is just Scream for Me Brazil in yet another package.  Good song set, playing Bruce's best solo work ever (Chemical Wedding Material), but it's too bad that the sound is poor and video is cut from video feeds from the crowd screens.  Pretty disapointing disc, could have been left out, made the package cost less, and no one would have missed it.  This keeps this DVD from getting 5 Stars       Disc three is the cool best part of this package.  The promo videos are just nice to have in one spot. The Tyranny of Souls promo video is interesting, and where else are you going to find the Samson footage.  All of the videos also have an intro option with bruce dickinson describing the story of each video (like knowing the \"Tatooed Millionaire\" video was directed by the pink floyd \"Learning to Fly\" directory...now the connection is made).  Nice job with the last disc.     Overall, I feel the skunkworks video and the Promo material are the best parts of this collection, and make it worth the 10 dollars I paid for this.  I would suggest to all to try an pay under 20 dollars for this collection, because the bulk of these DVD's is filler on disc two, and I would feel ripped off by it.       If you have been a long time maiden/dickinson fan, get this anyway.",

Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...    Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the   see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry.",

            "input": "\"Rocky\" meets \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" earns a split decision . 2 1/2 Stars.    There is nothing original in this story about a young man who is a disappointment to his father, has a problem with authority figures, and has yet to find his place in the world.  The plot is predictable from beginning to end and so cliche-ridden it will make your teeth ache.  James Franco has good screen presence and he can act, although he is limited.  Tyrese Gibson on the other hand is totally unbelievable in his role as Franco's antagonist.  He simply always looks like he's acting the entire time.  His character isn't even defined well and his reasons for going after Franco's character lacks sincerity and believability.    The direction and writing is just all over the place in this film that isn't sure what it want to be, so it tries very hard to be everything.  It wants to be a basic training kind of film a la \"G.I. Jane\" while also trying to be a sports film with its boxing substory.  It wants to introduce us to the world of a first class naval academy while also trying to tell us how naval vessels are built.  It throws in everything else from race relations to father and son psycho-babble.  I was waiting for the kitchen sink to be thrown in for good measure.    The film was okay overall when all was said and done.  I had some fun with it and Franco is fun to watch.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it was glaringly not as good as it could have been.  While viewing this film one is liable to keep saying, \"if they only did this\" or \"if they had only done that.\"  That leaves a bad taste in one's mouth",

The bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea. In this adaptation, Ben Mears was the kid who found the bodies of Hubie Marsten and his wife. The story begins in winter instead of late summer. Ralphie Glick doesn't just go missing, he's drowned in an icey pond. Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm.
