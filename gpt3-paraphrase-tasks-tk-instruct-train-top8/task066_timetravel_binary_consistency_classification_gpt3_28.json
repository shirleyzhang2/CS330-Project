If the given sentence does connect the first sentence with the rest of the story, output \"Yes\". If the given sentence does not connect the first sentence with the rest of the story, output \"No\". The given sentence is incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences form a consistent story."
