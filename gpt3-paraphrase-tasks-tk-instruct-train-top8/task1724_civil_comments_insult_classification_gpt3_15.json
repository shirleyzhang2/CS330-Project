The only logical way abortion will become illegal in the USA if it is deemed murder.  And murder is already a punishable offense so no more new law would be required.  In fact, both the mother and the doctor should face jail time under this fictional framework, with conspiracy thrown in for good measure.  HOWEVER, since abortion is not illegal, neither the mother nor the doctor face jail time in our country.  Both sides should just get over their overly dramatic tirades and simply get on with life.",

To conserve for the benefit of all generations of Alaskans.    Using the principal to produce earning to fund government (like Norway did for example) is certainly one way the fund, using a POMV payment model, would provide benefit to all generations of Alaskan's, not just the individuals who happen to live in Alaska for a year, then get a dividend that second year.",

When those occur, police departments need to re-evaluate their way of doing things.\n\nHowever, the biggest reform that should occur is the understanding that ALL LIVES MATTER. Cops should never treat the public as if we are all criminals in need of correction (or the Department of ), but as individuals who by and large aren't meaning to break the increasingly complex laws of this increasingly tyrannical government. If they approached all of their jobs in that way, there would be a whole lot fewer shootings, period! Any time a cop shoots a civilian, the facts should be screened by a citizen jury to assure there is no cover-up and if that jury decides there is cause, the cop should go to trial for Murder 1. Right there, shootings would drop dramatically.",
