            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

He's a hydraulics engineer-turned-author who's obsessively promoted the 7th Day Adventist doctrine of a \"young earth creation\" far outside the SDA denomination - doing nearly incalcuable damage to many churches. He's since gone on to promote the \"King James Only\" cult group which further seeks to spread 7th Day Adventist false doctrines among Baptist Fundamentalists, and even promoted a sort of astrology among Christians! Jesus said we'll know them by their fruits - Morris' fruit is churches ripped apart over the age of the Earth, and seekers convinced that the Bible isn't true because of Morris' bizarre interpretation of Genesis. Morris deserves nothing but a firm, unsympathetic rebuke for distorting the Bible, slandering other Christians ...and lying about science",

            "input": "sisters in crime . The best thing about Case Histories is that it is not a murder mystery. Kate Atkinson's novel has many of the characteristics of a traditional murder mystery - sympathetic gumshoe, unsolved crimes, supernumerary suspects, and cats - but the story is more a study of the confusion inherent in the innocent interactions of sisters and daughters.     I was pleased by the lifelike, sympathetic presentation of the two male characters. Unfortunately the many female characters never lifted off the page.     The plot of Case Histories consists of three unrelated cold cases. All the dramatic tension of the book consists of the promise that these cases will be connected by their resolution. But this resolution fails to materialize. The detective solves one murder, the perpetrator casually confesses to a second, and the third is disclosed only in an anonymous flashback. And the cats live happily ever after",
