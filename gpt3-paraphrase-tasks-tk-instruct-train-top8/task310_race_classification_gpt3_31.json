            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

            "input": "Article: French novelist Jules Verne (1828--1905) is often called the father of science fiction. Although he was not a great traveler himself, his characters travelled to the moon (inFrom the Earth to the Moon), under the sea (inTwenty thousand leagues under the sea), into a volcano (inA journey to the centre of the earth), around the world (inAround the World in Eighty Days) and to many other places. Jules Verne was born in the French city of Nantes in 1828. When he was a boy he ran away from home to work on a ship. However, his father soon found him and brought him home. After that he decided that any future travel he did would be in books. In 1847 his father sent Jules to Paris to study to be a lawyer. Even though he was busy writing, Verne passed his exams in 1849 with high marks. When Jules told his father he did not want to be a lawyer, his father was very angry. He stopped sending his son any money, so Jules had to earn a living by his writing. Over the next few years he wrote many stories and plays, which brought him only a little money. Then, in 1856, he met Honorine de Viane, a rich, young widow with two children. The couple married the next year. After his marriage, Verne worked as a businessman in Paris. However, he was not very successful at his job and spent most of his time writing books and doing research for the next one. In 1863 he published his novelFive Weeks in a balloonand the following year he publishedA Journey to the centre of the earthwhich made him famous. His books became so popular and earned him so much money that he was able to leave his job and work full time on his writing. In his Lifetime, Jules Verne wrote more than 50 books and he became a rich man. Many of this imaginative novels have been turned into films. \n Question: When Jules Verne was brought home by his father, he decided that   _  . \n Options: (A) he would devote himself to writing (B) he would go on more travels in the future (C) he would stop writing about future travels (D) he would do what his father required \n Asnwer: A",

But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling  a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment. In 1988, 14 - year - old Ray went with Dr. Tisman to a meeting of the American Federation for Clinical Research(AFCR), where Ray presented their initial research findings. Using terminology  beyond the grasp of most kids his age, Ray told the scientists how the new drug mixture caused fewer and milder side effects for cancer patients. A year later, Ray returned to the meeting to update the findings of his and Dr. Tisman's research. By then, he had become well - known for his devotion to finding cures for sick patients. Stories about him appeared in hundred of newspapers around the world. He appeared on television newscasts and talk shows. Ray continued to spend most free hours working with Dr. Tisman. The two began studying the effects of vitamins on babies inside the womb . However, Ray's main interest remained cancer treatment, and he continues his research today. \n Question: According to the passage, Ray   _   . \n Options: (A) is a boy of many gifts (B) is very helpful to his parents (C) learned fast under Dr. Tisman's instruction (D) stopped working with Dr. Tisman after his success \n Asnwer: C",

It has been cherished by all cultures alike, not only for its fine smell but also its valuable medicinal properties   , since 3000 B.C. Lavenders are a small plant group containing about 50 different species Today, \"true\" lavender can be found growing wild in Italy, France, on the eastern coast of Spain and right into North Africa. It is also commonly found in cultivated form throughout the rest of Europe, as well as in India, China, Australia, the U.S.A. and other countries. Most lavender is cultivated at the latitudes of 40-45 degrees north and south of the equator. Lavenders is popular in part because it is so useful. Its essential oil is a very safe oil which can be used for first-aid as well as for a wide variety of common problems such as skin complaints, muscular pain and childhood illnesses. It is recognized for its antiseptic qualities, its ability to drive insects away, and its usefulness in washing. It is also one of the most popular oils for cosmetics and perfumes. Lavender is also known for flavouring teas, cocktails, desserts and cakes, and is often added to salt and pepper to create the very famous Herbes de Provence   spice mixture. Its colour and smell have also made lavender a garden favourite for centuries, Finally, dried lavender has long been used as a spice to scent homes and closets. \n Question: Which of the following about lavender does the text NOT mention? \n Options: (A) its disadvantages (B) its characteristics.

            "input": "Article: A healthy amount of sunshine may be the secret to staying young. British scientists have discovered. Vitamin D is produced naturally by the skin in response to(...) sunlight and may help to slow the ageing process and protect against heart disease, according to the study. Researchers from King's College London studied 2,160 women aged between 18 and 79, looking at their telomeres--- a biological marker of ageing found in DNA. As people get older, their telomeres get shorter and they become more susceptible  to certain illnesses. But the study found women with high levels of vitamin D had comparatively longer telomeres--- a sign of being biologically younger and healthier. The study suggests vitamin D may help to slow down the ageing process of DNA, and therefore the ageing process as a whole. Lead researcher Dr Brent Richards said, \"These results are exciting because they show for the first time that people who have higher levels of vitamin D may age more slowly than people with lower levels of vitamin D.\" This could help to explain how vitamin D has a protective effect on many ageing related diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.\" Professor Tim Spector, a co-author of the report, added, \"Although it might sound absurd  , it's possible that the same sunshine which may increase our risk of skin cancer may also have a healthy effect on the general ageing process.\" Vitamin D made by the action of sunlight on the skin accounts for 90 percent of the body's supply, but lower levels can also be got through food such as fish, eggs and breakfast cereals . Other studies have suggested the vitamin plays a key role in protecting against cancer and heart disease. \n Question: A certain amount of sunshine helps people stay young because   _  . \n Options: (A) people feel happy and energetic in the sun (B) sunshine protects people against heart disease (C) vitamin D makes one's skin look young and healthy (D) vitamin D may help to slow the ageing process \n Asnwer: D",

I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. \"Why haven't we ever been there?' she wanted to know. \"Because we do everything ourselves online these days.\" I explained. \"But why do you do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?\" she wondered out loud. The answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving EUR30 on a EUR300 trip. All those EUR30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately, that does mean you spend too much time browsing Amason.com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book? Then the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post-office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money. The Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of the middle-men we were so eager to get rid of. In any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on \"cheap\" and \"good\" but the extra time we need to invest to also keep it \"fast\" comes out of our own pockets.

Diaz is a \"cable racer\", and every morning he faces the difficult task of taking the local teacher to her school. To do this, he first walks for an hour up to a place the locals call Los Pinos, right at the edge of the 400-foot deep gorge of the Negro valley. Here, one end of a thick metal cable has been fixed to a wooden post. The cable stretches right across the deep valley to the other side, a kilometer away. A metal hook is fixed to the cable, with leather straps hanging from it. Diaz fastens the straps around his shoulders and waist, does a quick safety check and then, without hesitating, throws himself off the edge of the mountain. Attached to the cable by only the metal hook, he rapidly picks up speed and soon he is racing through the air. Crossing the valley by wire takes him 30 seconds, instead of the two hours it would take him to walk down through the rain forest and climb up the steep muddy slopes on the other side. As Diaz begins his trip, Diana Rios, a 23-year-old elementary teacher, is waiting on the other side of the gorge for the moment when he will come racing through the mist towards her at 100 mph. She will then return with him, hanging on to him as he goes back along the cable. Diana had no idea when she took the teaching job that just getting to work in the village school would be dangerous. \"At first I wanted to cry,\" she says, clutching her hook as the metal cable starts to rattle  violently at Diaz's approach. \"But I soon got used to it.\" She still prefers to go with Diaz, though, rather than making the frightening and dangerous crossing on her own. For the inhabitants of Los Pinos, the wire cable is a lifeline. For more than 50 years, it has served the community as a form of transport to and from the rest of the world. Everything that comes arrives via the cable----bricks and wood for building, sacks of rice and corn. Pregnant mothers, who must get to the nearest clinic, cross the wire during the darkness of the night, returning with their newborn babies. It is dangerous, but they have no choice. This time Robinson Diaz makes a perfect landing on Diana's side of the gorge. For him, the dangers of this daily journey are insignificant. \"What I'm really scared of are snakes,\" he says. \"This is nothing in comparison.\" Then Dianna straps herself into her harness and hooks herself up to the wire behind Diaz, holding on to him tightly. He turns, flashes her a smile, releases the brake and kicks away. Within seconds, the teacher and the cable-racer have disappeared back into the mist. \n Question: Robinson Diaz has a difficult task every morning because he has to  _  . \n Options: (A) climb a long way up a mountain (B) get to the edge of a valley (C) walk through a dangerous area (D) help someone get to work \n Asnwer: D",
