Just something to ponder.....  Too scary for me to even think about........\nI am most sorry for my grandchildren, and what they may be in store for, with regards to future medical care.",

Let's see....who was it that gave automatic weapons to the drug cartels in the \"Fast and Furious\" fiasco?The goal of the NRA is to insure that the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens is not infringed.  The NRA is the advocate for law abiding citizens to maintain the ability to protect themselves and their families.  The NRA's sole purpose is to lobby against the liberal ideology like Hillary Clinton's which would like to turn the United States into a gunfree zone like Australia or France.....or Chicago. We are not like other countries and to take away the guns of law-abiding citizens is a fantasy you liberals have that would result in another Civil War. Period!  Fortunately for you, law-abiding gun owners will always prevail in this country to prevent common criminals and Hitlers of the world from controlling a defenseless citizenry.",
