        "Given an object and a part, you need to output 1 or 0 to indicate whether the object has that part as one of its components or not. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to output 1 if a gun has a barrel as one of its components, or 0 if it does not. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
