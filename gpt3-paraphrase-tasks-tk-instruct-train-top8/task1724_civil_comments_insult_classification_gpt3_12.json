They occupied a near-insignificant niche in total wildlife-taking.\n\nBut then the State had only about 200-250,000 people,  & there wasn't as nearly as much time & money for locals to be away from tasks of building and providing, to \"play\" at non-meat big game hunting. Game was primarily for food. \nNow we have less game & thanks to our bountiful State & oil economy, more wealthy Alaskan sport hunters. Frankly, guided hunting economics & interests have served pretty well as a check against over-hunting. I disagree with MANY BOG decisions- most clearly regarding wolf-culling and I'd like a far stronger non-hunter BOG presence. But guides have been a boon to conservation, to F&G managers and to BOG data.",
