I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

I like beef jerky, I like wagyu beef, I like truffles... put this combination together and I thought I would be in hooked, but after trying it I almost had to gag it down it was so awful. No offense to those of you who do enjoy it. I think the texture was spot on. It was not greasy or too hard or too soft. I just found all three flavors horrible. I gave the rest away along with the first batch of beef jerky I reviewed. I unfortunately cannot recommend this. I will keep looking and trying to find that ultimate beef jerky. \n Rating: 1",

I'm still going to use it because it's only for one day however for the $15 I paid I expected it to make it at least a few washes...

These stupid things pull a little hair out- then are a hassle to actually get the hair off the glove. Meanwhile normal shed brushes get a lot out quickly and it's nothing to clear the brush of the extracted hair. Literally, just a moment ago, I realized my dog is chewing up these worthless gloves and I don't care. Don't buy these for any reason. \n Rating: 1",
