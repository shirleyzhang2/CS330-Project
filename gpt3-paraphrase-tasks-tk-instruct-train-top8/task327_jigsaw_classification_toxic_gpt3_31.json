Trump wants to rebuild the economy and cutoff wasteful international tariffs that prevent American businesses from getting a foothold in the economy, as well as establish borders which all countries older than 100 years should have. Hillary wants to continue conflict in the middle east where thousands needlessly die and have their homes burnt to the ground by USA and it's partners, and tell you to shut up when she gets people killed or gets caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Not saying Trump wouldn't go to war but his priorities have middle east conflict on the backburner. As for as the wall I for one am tired of Juan and Pedro bringing cocaine across the Mexican border and lining their pockets with American dollars so yeah build the damn wall already.",
