            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.  \\nEarth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic \"Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound\" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\"  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?,\" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.\\nEarth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since \"Crisis;\" once in 1999's \"Kingdom Come,\" and most recently in 2005's \"Infinite Crisis.\"  What his role is in this maxiseries is undetermined as of this writing.  Earth 1's Superman has yet to reappear, but longtime fans can always hope.",
