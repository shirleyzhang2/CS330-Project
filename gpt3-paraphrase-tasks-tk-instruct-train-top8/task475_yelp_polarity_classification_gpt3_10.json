I ordered the Barrel Burger which was very tasty seasoned well but my bun was falling apart but I managed to get it all down the pickle was good too.\\n      I was super impressed with the design of the place with an open patio area cool furniture namely the cowhide bar stools. There was country music playing just loud enough to not wake a baby and I can't wait to go back for drinks and dinner with my wife maybe before the baseball game on St Patty's Day. It would be on my list to hit for drinks and a date for sure! \\n\\nWho ever designed this place gets 5 stars!\\n\\nI'll be back with friends and family.",

            "input": "My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and had lunch at Bahn Thai last week. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Just OK. It was also way overpriced. It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi.",

I am not normally a fan of this chain but they tend to have good food for the value. This location however is So Cool. So Tuesday July 30th my daughter wanted to come here for her birthday. We tried to make other suggestions but this is where she wanted to go. We met Jamie a manager here. She was so fun and invited us back the following week when they were having a Disney dress up day with the staff. Tuesday being kids night we were happy to return. They have the best balloon guy I have ever seen. He is just amazing.  Disney Tuesday was so much fun. Jamie played the evil queen and had my kids cracking up.   The food was wonderful and for the second week in a row the service was perfect. My kids no longer ask to go to chuck e cheese and we have a great meal at a great value. Thank You Jamie for making this restaurant a fun experience, not just a place to eat.",

The shops, well, that really does remind me of Venice somehow. The canal, the gondoliers, the sky-painted ceiling. There is a bit of Venetian magic there.",
