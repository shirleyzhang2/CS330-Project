You know, this reminds me of pictures I have seen of the civil rights marches of the sixties, with nuns in their habits dotting the sea of protesters and marchers.  Not a bishop among them, from what I could see, but our religious women were always there.  Inspiring for us all.  Now we have Nuns On The Bus showing us how to do exactly what you inspire us to do once again.  We must look to not only community/religious/political leaders to \"do something,\" but we must do something about the hatred, we must take action as we haven't done in a long, long time - if ever.  Without more and more of us, the demented sociopaths gain ground, a little bit at a time.  Let's take that ground back.",

Same damn premise anyone can lie to a doctor to get what they want.\n\nHence why proof is out moded.  Also this is why you're supposed to WASH your produce before you eat it.  Are you just ignorant on purpose or what? \n\nI'm way more concerned over people who don't wash their hands after using the toilet than I am some dog in a shopping cart. \n\nSome of those ESAs are cute but still considered an animal doing a service if the person says they have anxiety and a doctor agrees that it helps then boom.  They have a disability and fluffy can go anywhere they go.  Dinner, movies, etc",
