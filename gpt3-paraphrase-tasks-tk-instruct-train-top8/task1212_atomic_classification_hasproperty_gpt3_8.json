    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated by <sep>, determine whether the Head can be characterized by being or having the Tail. \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers should be based on whether the Head is generally described by the Tail, if the Tail is a subjective attribute of the Head, or if the Tail is a descriptor that speaks to the substance or value of the Head. The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
