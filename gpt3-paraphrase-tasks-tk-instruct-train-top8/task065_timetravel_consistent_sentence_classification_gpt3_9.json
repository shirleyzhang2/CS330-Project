        "In this task, you are given a short story consisting of exactly 5 sentences. The second sentence is missing, and you are given two options to choose from. You need to select the option that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If the first option is correct, indicate your answer by 'Option 1'. Otherwise, indicate your answer by 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
