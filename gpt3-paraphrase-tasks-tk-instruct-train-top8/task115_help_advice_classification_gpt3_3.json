        "Read the given sentence and indicate via \"yes\" if it is a general advice. Otherwise indicate via \"no\". General advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. This can come in a variety of forms, such as Direct advice and Indirect advice. Direct advice uses words (e.g., suggest, advice, recommend), verbs (e.g., can, could, should, may), or questions (e.g., why don't you's, how about, have you thought about) to state the suggestion directly. Indirect advice contains hints from personal experiences with the intention for someone to do the same thing or statements that imply an action should (or should not) be taken."
