        "You will be given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into two classes: 'disagree' or 'agree'. Classify the comment as 'disagree' if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as 'agree' otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

After all, gas prices at the pump went up $0.14/litre overnight in November and there were no riots. A large portion of electricity and natural gas bills are fixed costs which are not made worse by the carbon tax.

We weren't a good fit and my ex-wife was more interested in my \"resources\" and what they afforded her to do than being a contributing partner in our relationship. The divorce cost me about $40,000 and I have paid a total of $432,000 in child and spousal support during this time as she has remarried TWICE. When I initiated the split she told me she would take me for everything and continues to do so to this day. In the mean time I focused on living in my tiny house and trying to be the best dad to my kids. Both have completely pulled away from me in their teens because I have insisted on them going to school and having responsibilities. Their mother has been entirely hands off. She parties, rides her horses while I struggle to convince my kids to improve attendance at school, avoid weed, and work hard. They won't listen. It's been hell. Why would I want to go through this again?. It's been financial devastation.",
