        "You will be given an object and a part. You need to decide if the object has the given part as one of its components or parts. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel. The answer should be 1 or 0, where 1 means the object has the given part, and 0 means the object doesn't have the part."
