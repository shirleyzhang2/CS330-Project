        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Disagree means that the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. Agree means that the comment is not likely to raise public disagreement. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

But I have been thinking that that post was wrong. The fear that disguises itself as fact must be dealt with, and it is worth condemning for the terrible things that it does\n\nYou are right that people are \"concerned\" (your first line). They are afraid that our situation is the same as Europe's, but it is not. The only place from where it is easy to cross into Canada is the U.S. It is very difficult to get to Canada and the U.S. because of geography.\n\nThere are no facts that say Islam is the world's most violent religion. Who, after all, has most of the world's largest, most powerful militaries? Christians.\n\nThe rest of what you say is just simply wrong. I doubt that you are lying. You are just imagining something inaccurately, and it is frightening you. And that has to stop.",
