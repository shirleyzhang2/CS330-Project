            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

Although several general news outlets posted about the Popeye\u2019s product, readers and social media users remained on high alert for leg pulls and marketing stunts based on the topics of the day \u2014 in this case, the ongoing controversy around emotional support animal companions and air travel:Delta says it saw an 84 percent increase in reported incidents involving service and support animals in 2016 and 2017. According to the trade group Airlines for America, airlines in the US saw a 74 percent increase overall in emotional support animals from 2016 to 2017. This increase has caused other major airlines including American and United to\u00a0tighten their policies.Even if you haven\u2019t encountered a nonhuman passenger on your own flight, you\u2019ve probably heard one of the viral stories about one, which seem to surface every few weeks. In January [2018], a woman was barred from bringing her\u00a0emotional support peacock\u00a0on a United flight, even when she offered to buy the bird its own seat.Likely owing in part to the evergreen popularity of the debate, Popeye\u2019s advertisement of a new purported product relating to emotional support animals proved popular on social media:Sorry, Fido. Popeyes #EmotionalSupportChicken doesn\u2019t bark on the plane. (Available in the Philadelphia airport on 12/18.) pic.twitter.com/vWyBWq4PTe\u2014 Popeyes Chicken (@PopeyesChicken) December 18, 2018Popeye\u2019s issued a press release on December 18, 2018 about its purported new product:There is no doubt the holiday season is one of the busiest and most stressful travel times of the year. The airports are crowded, the delays are frustrating, and travelers are stressed about getting from point A to point B with gifts in hand. This year, POPEYES\u00ae is launching \u201cEmotional Support Chicken\u201d to provide a good-hearted laugh most need to get through stressful holiday air travel. Starting Tuesday, December 18 [2018], travelers passing through Philadelphia International Airport can purchase their fried chicken meal with an \u201cEmotional Support Chicken\u201d carrier at the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen in Terminal C to bring with them on their flight.Emotional support animals provide comfort and companionship, especially during a highly stressful time like air travel. However, according to recent headlines, some travelers are pushing the envelope with the types of animals they try to bring on flights and classify as \u201cemotional support animals,\u201d including the likes of peacocks, squirrels and tarantulas. Knowing this, Popeyes decided to launch its new \u201cEmotional Support Chicken\u201d to bring holiday travelers some humor to what is one of the most stressful places to be during the holidays \u2013 the airport.As is often the case with headline-grabbing fast food news, Popeye\u2019s \u201cEmotional Support Chicken\u201d promotion was a bit overhyped for its real-world impact. The product was only available at one location (Philadelphia International Airport), and only while supplies lasted. Overall, the announcement largely served to get Popeye\u2019s a bunch of news mentions, with little substance behind the novelty item.

            "input": "Paragraph: \"In metro Atlanta, the land of smog alerts and farmland-turned-to-suburbs, one local county makes a bold claim about its efforts to be environmentally conscious. DeKalb County, its website says, is \"\"the greenest county in America.\"\" Let's put that on some recycled paper and send it to each of the county's estimated 750,000 residents. DeKalb's communications director, Burke Brennan, sent PolitiFact Georgia an e-mail making the case for the county. It includes: \"\"In DeKalb County, we are taking the lead on sustainability ...\u00a0 we are one step closer to being the greenest county in America,\"\" DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis said in 2009 when the county was honored by the ARC. Many folks we discussed this claim with used phrases like \"\"bold\"\" or \"\"ambitious\"\" to describe DeKalb's audacity, not willing to publicly dismiss it. Some were willing to criticize the claim. \"\"That's all a good case for them to be one of the greenest counties in Georgia,\"\" said Mark Woodall, Georgia chapter chairman of the Sierra Club, which claims to be the largest grassroots environmental organization in the state. \"\"DeKalb being the greenest county in America seems pretty unthinkable.\"\" Being \"\"green,\"\" means many things these days. Some organizations have occasionally released surveys rankings America's greenest cities, but we found few similar rankings of counties. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to improve health and health care for Americans, earlier this year looked at the environmental health of each U.S. county. One category was physical health. The foundation used data put together by researchers from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the physical health of each county. The criteria included how many days the air was unhealthy, the number of days the air was unhealthy due to ozone, access to healthy foods and how many liquor stores were in a county. DeKalb ranked near the bottom of Georgia counties, 153rd, in terms of physical health. Some categories that DeKalb is bragging about are difficult to compare. In other areas, such as the number of LEED-certified buildings, Dekalb has competition. Gwinnett had three LEED-certifiied structures, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. DeKalb is an Energy Star partner -- a federal effort to protect the environment through energy-efficient practices -- but so are Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. On hiking and biking trails, DeKalb may run into some argument about having the most in Georgia. Cobb County, for example, lists about 75 miles of trails within its cities and unincorporated areas. It was suggested we look at Arlington County, Va. to find another county that could make a case it is greener than DeKalb. The county has a page on its website with more than a dozen awards and recognition for its sustainable community and environmental efforts. Arlington won two National Association of Counties Achievement Awards this year for its recycling efforts. That organization also named Arlington its Outstanding Civil Engineering Project award in 2006 for its Green Building Program. Other counties, like Boulder, Colo., have goals such as reducing outdoor water use by 50 percent by using indigenous plants and recycling 50 percent of construction waste. DeKalb's case was muddied in December when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined $453,000 for 836 sewage spills over the last five years. The EPA estimates there are about 40,000 spills from the nation's 25,000 sewage systems a year. California officials reported about 2,000 spills into the San Francisco Bay in 2008. Brennan noted the day after the fine was announced, county commissioners voted 6-1 to spend $1.345 billion to make repairs to its water and sewer system, nearly twice as much money as the EPA recommended. DeKalb taxpayers will pay higher water and sewer bills to help fund the work. Despite the fine, Brennan stuck by DeKalb's claim. \"\"Nobody here is claiming perfection, but based on the programs, awards, designations and initiatives DeKalb has in place and ongoing, I am sticking with the motto 'DeKalb is the greenest county in America,' \"\" Brennan told us in an e-mail. \"\"After all, 'Cowboy Capital of the World' was already taken,\"\" added Brennan, referring to Oakdale, Calif.  DeKalb has certainly tried to make its mark as an environmentally conscious county. But DeKalb's claim of being the \"\"greenest county\"\" in the nation ignores critical facts that would give a visitor to its web site a different impression.\" Claim: The Greenest County in America.",

Tidbits from various reports have been used to make a number of claims about John Kerry\u2019s ties to Iranian nuclear negotiators. These reports\u00a0argue that Kerry should have recused himself from nuclear talks with Iran because of conflicts of interest. Let\u2019s take a look at claims\u00a0that have frequently appeared: John Kerry\u2019s Daughter Married an Iranian John Kerry\u2019s daughter married a man of Iranian descent, but he was born and raised in America. Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Vanessa was practicing internal medicine there, and Nahed was practicing neurological surgery, according to a New York Times wedding announcement: The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the\u00a0University of California, Los Angeles, and received his\u00a0medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a\u00a0pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care\u00a0physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in\u00a0Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice\u00a0there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Nahed\u00a0was born in New York, according to his Mass General bio. John Kerry Concealed His Son-in-Law\u2019s Iranian Bloodlines This one is mostly fiction. John Kerry acknowledged his family\u2019s connection to Iran in a statement that was released on the Iranian New Year in March 2013: It\u2019s a privilege to join President Obama in sending warm\u00a0wishes for health and prosperity to the people of Iran and all\u00a0those who celebrate Nowruz around the world. As you gather with your loved ones around the Sofreh Haft-Seen, we are proud to note that many Americans will join you\u00a0in celebrating Nowruz. This year, we are once again reminded\u00a0of the outstanding contributions of Iranian-Americans and\u00a0Iranian students here in the United States, which reflect the\u00a0rich history of your culture. I am proud of the Iranian-Americans in my own family, and grateful for how they have\u00a0enriched my life. Kerry made the admission after a website operated by the Iranian government reported that his son-in-law was an Iranian-American and had still relatives in Iran. The report was published as Kerry faced a Senate confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, so it wasn\u2019t a \u201csecret.\u201d Kenneth Timmerman, president of the Foundation for Democracy in Iran, described the timing of Kerry\u2019s statement in a column that appeared in the Daily Caller: Was the Iranian publication itself a subtle form\u00a0of blackmail, aimed at letting Kerry know that\u00a0the regime is fully aware of his son-in-law\u2019s\u00a0extended family in Iran? The Islamic Republic\u00a0systematically puts pressure on family\u00a0members of prominent Iranian-Americans (for\u00a0example, individuals who work at the Persian\u00a0service of Voice of America), to make sure that\u00a0they do not engage in hostile statements or\u00a0activities against the Tehran regime. Certainly, Secretary Kerry has long favored a\u00a0U.S. rapprochement with the Islamic Republic. He has repeatedly appeared with groups such\u00a0as the American Iranian Council (AIC), and has\u00a0taken money from Iranian-Americans for his\u00a0political campaigns,\u00a0including at least one\u00a0illegal donation\u00a0from an Iranian woman who\u00a0did not have a green card. So he didn\u2019t need\u00a0to have an Iranian-American family member to\u00a0believe that the United States should forge\u00a0direct relations with the Islamic Republic or\u00a0ease U.S. pressure on the regime. Kerry may have figured that by revealing the\u00a0family tie himself he could diffuse the situation,\u00a0and make it more difficult for the regime to put\u00a0pressure on his son-in-law\u2019s family. Of course,\u00a0that\u2019s assuming Kerry in fact plans to do\u00a0anything that angers the regime. Besides, the New York Times ran a wedding announcement in 2009 that quoted Kerry, so it wouldn\u2019t have been a very well guarded secret. The Son of an Iranian Foreign Minister Was the Best Man in John Kerry\u2019s Daughter\u2019s Wedding-Reported as Fiction! There\u2019s no proof that this one is true. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The rumor that Zarif\u2019s son was the best man in Kerry\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding started with a post on Allen B. West\u2019s website in July 2015: Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a\u00a0decade ago at a dinner party hosted by\u00a0George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the\u00a0dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the\u00a0best man at the 2009 wedding between\u00a0Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala\u00a0Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son. The story doesn\u2019t cite a source, but Vanessa Kerry Nahed quickly shot the rumor down. She tweeted that her husband didn\u2019t have a best man because they didn\u2019t have a bridal party at their wedding. An Iranian news agency called the report a\u00a0\u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: Officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday\u00a0strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that\u00a0Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had\u00a0attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the\u00a0daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American\u00a0websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi\u00a0Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr.\u00a0Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband\u00a0doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best\u00a0man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to\u00a0hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit\u00a0and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies\u00a0have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent\u00a0nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a\u00a020 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning. It is true, however, that Kerry has a personal relationship with\u00a0Zarif that predates\u00a0the nuclear talks. The diplomats\u2019 relationship was reported in a 2012 book by author Hooman Majd. Claim:  Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s daughter married an Iranian man with connections to an Iranian foreign minister who participated in nuclear negotiations. ",

Researchers in the Netherlands have released research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, on an antibody against the new coronavirus. A 103 year-old Chinese grandmother has made a full recovery from Covid-19 after being treated for 6 days in Wuhan, China This has been widely reported in the media. Apple has reopened all 42 China stores. Correct. On 13 March 2020, Apple announced that it had reopened all 42 stores in mainland China after a closure of almost six weeks. Cleveland Clinic developed a Covid-19 test that gives results in hours, not days. The number of new cases in South Korea is declining. Italy is hit hard, experts say, only because they have the oldest population in Europe. Whilst it is true that an older population has contributed to a high number of deaths in Italy, it may not be the sole reason. Scientists in Israel are likely to announce the development of a coronavirus vaccine. Scientists in Israel and elsewhere are working on developing a vaccination to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, but it won\u2019t be ready for the public for over a year. Three Maryland coronavirus patients fully recovered and are able to return to everyday life. Correct. On 13 March 2020, Montgomery County, Maryland confirmed that three residents who previously had the virus no longer tested positive. A network of Canadian scientists are making excellent progress in Covid-19 research. At least one group of Canadian scientists has recently announced some progress in understanding Covid-19. A San Diego biotech company is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with Duke University and National University of Singapore. Tulsa County's first positive Covid-19 case has recovered. This individual has had two negative tests, which is the indicator of recovery. Correct, this patient has recovered according to official Tulsa County sources. Two negative tests is one of three official indicators of recovery among people with Covid-19 (who showed symptoms). All seven patients who were getting treated for Covid-19 at Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi have recovered. There is a news story reporting that seven patients in this hospital in New Delhi had recovered. However, these were not the only Covid-19 patients in the city. Plasma from newly recovered patients from Covid -19 can treat others infected by Covid-19. This is being used as a treatment in some countries, but clinical trials have not yet proved that this is effective.

            "input": "Paragraph: Darren Salter, senior coroner for the county of Oxfordshire in southern England, said a post-mortem has found that the singer died of \u201cdilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver.\u201d Dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the left ventricle of the heart becomes stretched and weakened, limiting the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle. The former Wham! singer-songwriter was found dead at his country home in Oxfordshire on Dec. 25. He was 53. An initial autopsy failed to determine the cause of death for the star, who had battled health problems and drug addiction. Salter said that because Michael died of natural causes, there will be no coroner\u2019s inquest or further inquiries. In Britain, inquests are held to determine the facts of unexplained deaths. Police initially investigated and took witness statements in order to establish the facts surrounding Michael\u2019s death, which they called \u201cunexplained but non-suspicious.\u201d Wham!, formed by Michael and his friend Andrew Ridgeley, topped charts in the 1980s with exuberant pop hits including \u201cWake Me Up Before You Go-Go,\u201d \u2033Young Guns (Go For It)\u201d and \u201cFreedom.\u201d Michael went on to a solo career studded with major hits including \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d and \u201cFaith\u201d and sold more than 100 million albums around the world. He suffered problems with drugs and alcohol, however, and in 2010 was briefly jailed after crashing his Range Rover into a shop front near his London home while high on prescription drugs and marijuana. Michael had experienced health problems including a bout of pneumonia in 2011 that saw him hospitalized in intensive care. He said later it had been \u201ctouch and go\u201d whether he would survive. Michael\u2019s former partner, Kenny Goss, has said he thinks the musician\u2019s body \u201cjust gave up.\u201d Dilated cardiomyopathy can be an inherited condition, or can be caused by factors such as viral infections and high blood pressure. Myocarditis is usually caused by a viral, bacterial or fungal infection, while fatty liver disease can be caused by alcohol, or by other factors that cause a buildup of fat in the liver. Michael\u2019s death prompted an outpouring of recognition for his musical gifts as well as his charitable work in support of causes including AIDS groups, cancer charities and Childline, which offers confidential phone counseling for young people. Paying tribute to Michael at the Brit Awards last month, Ridgeley said that with his death, \u201ca supernova in a firmament of shining stars has been extinguished.\u201d At the Grammys, Adele performed Michael\u2019s song \u201cFastlove\u201d \u2014 restarting the rendition because she said the tribute was \u201ctoo important\u201d to mess up.

And yet, claims likening coronavirus to the common cold persist, including in a Facebook post that says: \"\"The coronavirus: The Democrats are using it to promote fear. The Chinese are using it to control protestors. And all along it\u2019s simply the common cold.\"\" Gesundheit, but we've been here before. The 2019 coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that includes the common cold, but the two are not the same. This Facebook post is wrong. The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat  news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease, officially known as COVID-19, in Wuhan, China, in December, we\u2019ve fact-checked several  claims that aim to downplay the severity of the virus and to blame the media, politicians or pharmaceutical companies for drawing attention to it. One such claim came from conservative radio talk show host and recent Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Rush Limbaugh, who said the coronavirus is the common cold. Our rating was . As we reported: There are seven types of coronaviruses that can infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of those viruses, which are named for their crown-like structure, can cause colds. Most strains of the coronavirus are relatively mild and take the form of respiratory diseases such as the common cold. But more serious strains have emerged over the last two decades, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread across the globe in 2003. According to the CDC, the 2019 coronavirus is a \"\"beta coronavirus\"\" similar to SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which was first identified in 2012. All three viruses have their origins in bats, and all three can induce symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2014 similar to some common colds. More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains \"\"usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory-tract illnesses, like the common cold.\"\" But the same fact sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. \"\"This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,\"\" it said. The majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, according to the CDC. Cases range from mild to moderate in severity, and many adults get two or three colds per year. Children are more likely to get them. In contrast, cases of the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to suffer complications from COVID-19, while children are not. The virus has an estimated 3.4% mortality rate. In short, the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December 2019. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold. Despite the differences, prevention for both the 2019 coronavirus and the common cold are relatively similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face and stay away from people who are sick.\" Claim: The coronavirus is \u201csimply the common cold.\u201d",

Denver has seen steep declines in sales, lodging and other taxes since the pandemic hit Colorado two months ago, and the state is still under a safer-at-home order that has placed restrictions on businesses. City leaders say the drop in tax revenue is affecting the fund that pays for police and fire services, as well as street maintenance. American cities, from Puyallup, Washington, to Miramar, Florida, have also furloughed employees to save money in the face of dire economic forecasts. In April, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a spending plan he called \u201ca document of our pain\u201d that includes service cuts and furloughs for nearly 16,000 workers. Under the proposal, city employees would take 26 furlough days, the equivalent of a 10% pay cut, in the coming year. The spending reductions in Los Angeles are likely to be a sign of what\u2019s to come at city halls across the nation, as jobless lines grow and local treasuries see steep drops in tax revenue. Denver\u2019s planned furloughs, which do not apply to uniformed employees like firefighters, police officers and sheriff\u2019s deputies, will save the city about $16 million. The city also is reducing travel, hiring and purchases, and it is asking departments to cut 7.5% from their budgets. About 3,000 of Denver\u2019s 12,000 employees are uniformed workers. \u201cI want everyone to know that we have worked to exhaust every other tool we had before taking this step,\u201d said Hancock, who repeated his call for lawmakers to include cities in the next federal stimulus package. \u201cThe reality is this: If cities can\u2019t recover, there will be no national recovery,\u201d he said. Brendan Hanlon, the city\u2019s chief financial officer, said he thought the fallout from the 2008-2009 Great Recession was astonishing, but the current crisis will be harder to address. \u201cI could have never imagined seeing the numbers that we\u2019re seeing right now and the gravity that it means to the services that we provide to the public every day here in Denver,\u201d he said. The city last instituted furloughs in 2011. A survey by the National League of Cities found nearly universal agreement that cities would be hit hard by revenue shortfalls caused by the coronavirus outbreak, and in many cases furloughs and layoffs would be used to close budget gaps.

            "input": "Paragraph: There is also the revival of the humble foam roller, which experts say, like old-time push-ups, squats and planks, has never been more popular. Anita Golden, fitness manager at a Crunch gym in New York City, said she\u2019ll be giving clients a foam roller called the GRID. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had foam rollers in the club but now more people are using them as a way to ease post-workout muscles, prevent injuries and exercise the core,\u201d Golden said. When it comes to big-ticket items, Colleen Logan of Icon Health and Fitness, which manufactures a number of fitness brands, said the treadmill remains the most popular gift. \u201cTreadmills continue to lead the industry in terms of home fitness purchases,\u201d said Logan. They account for about 57 percent of fitness purchases, while elliptical trainers and stationary bicycles are a distant second and third place at about 8 percent each. The average home treadmill costs about $700, said Logan, but the technology revolution has transformed even this stalwart at the high end. The ultimate splurge, at $4,000, she said, is the Boston Marathon Treadmill, which allows users to adjust speed in 1/10 of a mile per hour increments without touching the console. It also lets users run a virtual Boston Marathon. For people on a smaller budget, there is the iFit app that lets the iPhone capture a favorite vacation run or bike ride in Hawaii, store it in data centers all over the world which collectively are referred to as the \u201ccloud,\u201d and download it to an iFit-enabled treadmill at home. \u201cYou\u2019ll view the exact route and experience the same terrain again,\u201d Logan explained. Devices, gadgets and apps proliferate as tech-savvy fitness becomes more accessible, according to Jessica Matthews of the American Council on Exercise (ACE). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest in on-body monitoring devices as ways to motivate and track progress,\u201d she said. \u201cThey run the gamut from basic devices to track hours, steps, and caloric expenditure to full-body tracking.\u201d  Nike+ Sportsband has a series of small lights on the wrist band that change from red to green as the runner nears his goal, while the BodyMedia FIT Armband tracks everything from the number of calories burned to the quality and quantity of sleep. ACE also studied fitness DVDs released for the holidays. \u201cWe evaluated them for quality of instruction, safety, effectiveness and design of workout,\u201d Matthews said. Among the best were \u201cAmy Dixon\u2019s Breathless Body Vol.2: The Edge.\u201d Matthews called it a challenging cardio workout best suited to those on your list with \u201can established base of fitness.\u201d  \u201cJessica Smith\u2019s 10 Pounds Down Better Body Blast\u201d also got a thumbs up for its well-rounded routine and clarity of instruction. For people seeking a mind-body approach, Matthews praised \u201cSTOTT Pilates Intense Body Blast: Pilates Interval Training: Level I,\u201d which she said is accessible for someone new to fitness. \u201cThey do a great job queuing movements and creating flow,\u201d she said. Richard Cotton of the American College of Sports Medicine suggests giving the fitness novice the gift of a personal trainer. \u201cThe best is human assistance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother way is a beginner group exercise class.\u201d  He also suggests a gift certificate for shoes at a running store equipped with a treadmill. \u201cYou need shoes that fit your gait,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should always get their gait analyzed.\u201d  Golden likes to cite the law of reciprocity to the personal trainers she manages. \u201cI always tell them to get their clients something,\u201d she said. And what does the personal trainer want for Christmas? \u201cI like the roller, or a new jump rope,\u201d she said. \u201cFitness people aren\u2019t hard to please. Get me a new yoga mat and I\u2019m happy.\u201d Claim: Holiday fitness gifts trend from high-tech to basic.",
