After getting a few quotes from 2 other places decided to go with this shop based on their reviews and price. Called Mac (estimator) back to see how long it would take for them to order me an oem bumper. Said he would call back and let me know. 3 days past still no call. Called them back and Jason (the guy answering phones) said he would have Mac give me a call back again. another 2 days and finally got a call back but only gave me an estimate on just paint not the bumper. Told him I wanted him to order me an oem bumper and get it painted he could not figure out the color of my car, said he would call me back. Waited a week for his call back. Nothing. This auto shop clearly does not want to do business so I'll take my business some where else.",

I was amazed at the quality of products so I decided to pop along and check this place out!\\nI wasn't disappointed, it's a lovely little cafe, really organic-feeling and has a lovely atmosphere.

Plus they have a frequent visitor card that can be filled up fairly quickly if the rest of the family is in tow.\\n\\nThe top flavors served here in my opinion are Passion Fruit and Strawberry.  The best topping, especially for the money is fresh blueberries.  But I can't resist getting those chewy mochi bites when I go out for fro-yo, and they have it here!  No lychee though (sorry Paolo).\\n\\nOf the two ladies that worked there during our visit, one was particularly friendly and greeted customers as they entered.  The other one can at least play the role, as that is a big part of the experience at a self-served fro-yo place.\\n\\nThings to improve upon:\\nLabels for toppings - people can easily get annoyed not knowing or having to ask for each and everyone.\\n\\nAll employees on shift should be a happy employee, even if they have to fake it like some women with the O.",

            "input": "I guess they just opened a location here at Sky Harbor. I had never been to the original location, so I guess this is a truly objective review. \\n\\nI'm not from Phoenix; just here for work and decided to have lunch here before my flight back home. But I wasn't that satisfied. \\n\\nFirst impressions: great looking menu. I love american breakfast so I was very excited to try it out. I remember seeing the original location on an episode of Triple D as well. Apparently there's always a huge wait at the original location; definitely not the case here. I was seated in 10 seconds. Few reasons include the new location, noobie visitors who have never heard of it, and just the location in general. It's airport food, so you're only going to eat it because it's convenient. I wonder if anyone's ever booked a flight for another airline just because they know MBB is at Terminal 4! Furthermore, there's also a take-out section of the entrance that was completely empty as well. \\n\\nThe service was lacking. Don't get me wrong, the waitresses were very friendly, but they're definitely not on their game. First of all, I was seated at a long counter area that had customers on both sides -- not a problem. Probably could have sat 15 people staggered. Most people are dining alone anyways so no complaints on my end. What made me a little fed up was they seated another man RIGHT in front of me. Mind you, they were NOT busy and the counter is hardly 2 ft wide, so this man was pretty much breathing on my food. If I had leaned in another foot, I could have kissed the guy. I'm sure he wasn't happy either. Dude, stagger your customers if they're dining alone. If all other seats are taken, ask for the permission of both parties. The rest of the counter is empty. Even the guys next to me at their booth were like wtf. C'mon. \\n\\nEvery single person around me was missing something before they even got their food. I didn't receive a straw. My new involuntary best friend in front of me didn't get a napkin or utensils. And the other tables around me didn't get utensils or condiments. Get it together MBB!\\n\\nNow onto the food. I ordered the Chop & Chick and asked for a waffle instead of toast; didn't mind paying extra. Waffle wasn't bad; tastes like a pretty good waffle I could have made at home. The pork chop and home fries had way too much rosemary. Also, the home fries weren't fries at all, they were just stir fried potatoes, but apparently most people are aware of this so that's my problem. The pork chop was good, a tad but overcooked but the flavor was good. Nothing I'd go out of the way for. and not that juicy either. \\n\\nWhen I received my check, I noticed that I was charged for 2 full meals when I simply asked for one replacement item on my meal. They had charged me for a full waffle plate as well as the full chop & chick. The waffle plate comes with bacon ( I didn't receive bacon) and they didn't subtract the toast from my order. The toast wasn't a big deal at all, but the waitress could have told me that they don't have waffles a la carte instead of making me pay for 2 whole meals. This is NOT acceptable. \\n\\nI was running late for my flight, so I didn't have the time to waive down the waitress. I just paid for the bill and left pretty irked. My meals are covered by the company, so whatever. \\n\\nWon't be coming back here again. 2 stars.",
