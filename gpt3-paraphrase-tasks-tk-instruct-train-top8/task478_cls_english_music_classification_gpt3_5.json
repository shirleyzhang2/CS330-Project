I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

            "input": "20 years ago... . Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.      It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad \"Be Not Always\" and the danceable \"State of Shock.\"      \"State of Shock\" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)    And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, \"Body\" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, \"Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!\" or words to that effect.",

I have been a fan of Faith's since the beginning and I must say her music doesn't disappoint.  While the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'Faith', they are still quite good, particularly the songs written by Lori McKenna.  After hearing Faith sing her songs, I went out and bought Lori's album 'Bittertown', which is quite simply an incredible album.  On 'Fireflies' Faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song.  Songs that I particularly enjoy are \"Stealing Kisses\", \"I Want You\", \"Paris\" and \"Mississippi Girl\".  I've read other reviews that said 'Fireflies' left them confused.  The album's songs do lack cohesiveness at times, but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of Faith's voice.  She has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music",

They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype \"punk\" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see \"alternative\" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other \"serious\", \"sensitive\" \"hip\" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days).",

They had a bona fide producer in Kay Gee (Naughty by Nature), incredible vocal chemistry, heavy-duty promotion, and catchy singles. This resulted in an impressive debut. So why the snub? I guess that will always be a mystery. Anywho, along with Blackstreet and Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number, Pronounced Jah-Nay ranks as one of the top five BEST hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994. And here's why.    It was a very cohesive record, consisting of FIVE R&B entries, with \"Hey Mr. D.J.\", \"Groove Thang\", and \"Sending My Love\" making the top five. You think that's the story? NOT!. The story is how good the REST of the album is. In fact, I will say (like other VERY strong debuts) that the album tracks are BETTER than the singles. And that's saying a lot, given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990's. Those tracks are: \"Sweet Taste of Love\", \"Changes\", \"La La La\", \"For A Reason\" and \"Hey Mr. D.J. Remix\". That's eight cuts that should get played everytime it's in the CD player. It doesn't get much better than that.    In sum, Zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records. However, their fame didn't last long. They would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set. But their debut will never be forgotten. It's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh. And that's what makes it irresistibly catchy. A hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one, but a casual listener should as well.    Grade: A",
