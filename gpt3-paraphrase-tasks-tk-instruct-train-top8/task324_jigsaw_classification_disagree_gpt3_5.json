            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

A couple of these punks were involved in a similar act of crime recently and bounced back on the street in a few months, escalated their behaviors to  kidnapp and brutally murder our David. Why were their sentences a slap on the wrist? Why were they free in our community? Please I beg you do not allow any of these murderers back on our  streets ever again. The Alaska State Troopers did their job and now it is up to the legal system and the Judge to do their job.  #justiceforgrunwald. A message must be sent to our community that our legal system works and  if you do a crime you will do the time.",
