These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

The fact that Kelly was so upset about Amber being pregnant and posing nude, just didn't make sense to me. Young people mimic what their role models do.
