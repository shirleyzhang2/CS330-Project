A recent, vile case involved the killing of many walrus with semi- automatic weapons, and the only thing harvested were the tusks. \n\nWhere do you think the Chinese are going to turn when they can no longer illegally import elephant and rhino ivory due to loss of these animals?\n\nAnd you do understand walrus are under significant threat due to the loss of sea ice?",

Thinking this will be affordable if everyone attends traditional \"bricks and mortar\" institutions of higher edu is wishful thinking IMO.",
