I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",

Before purchasing, we couldn\u2019t walk through our kitchen without wet socks and feet from slobber and water from our dogs\u2019 water dish. We resorted to having to leave the water outside because the water was too much to keep up with. This water bowl is a awesome! My dogs figured it out quickly and there is little to no water dripped onto the floor!!! I like that it\u2019s a stainless steel bowl and gallon sized so it\u2019s easy to clean and we are not having to constantly refill the bowl. This product has saved me a lot of hassle and irritation about having to constantly clean up water from my floors.",
