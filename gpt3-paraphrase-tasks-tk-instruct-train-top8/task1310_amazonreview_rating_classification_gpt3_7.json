I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

The volume level is far less than expected from similar products I've purchased in the same price point. Lastly, the battery performance was less than I had expected. Five to six hours was a maximum on full charge for me. I will attest to the ease of connectivity, sleek and minimal design, and lightweight of this product. Probably good for some; it's worth mentioning that there is no way to secure the earbuds when they are not in use. When unsecured they dangle freely around the neck or chest. They also pick up plenty of ambient noise as they all do. I hope this helps!",
