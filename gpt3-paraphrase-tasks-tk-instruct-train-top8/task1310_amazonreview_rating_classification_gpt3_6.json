I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

The color was covered by gold glitter and red patches all over; definitely not leather, not even fake leather, moreso a low-cost fabric material covering. Not what I was expecting and made it look very cheap. Gave 2 stars since I did like how the inside of the portfolio was set up. Overall not a fan and ended up returning.",

There is a very huge amount of play in the stick which if you are looking for very accurate movement you will have to adjust the settings in the games to combat this. For the price you can't go wrong. I have had a few of these in the past and they last forever. I am sure you can also mod the stick to give it less play if you want.",
