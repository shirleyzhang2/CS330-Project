The law also says no speeding and everyone must stop at stop signs, but few people obey those laws either and those have actual safety consequences to other people. There are laws against littering but few care about that, if the state of Anchorage tells us anything.   People break laws all the time and I don't think there's a single person whose horse is so high they can criticize others for ignoring minor, pointless laws. There are plenty of dogs who behave just fine off leash and I've no problem with that.  Crappy dogs should not be off leash, or even out in public, but well-behaved dogs don't cause problems on leash or off.",
