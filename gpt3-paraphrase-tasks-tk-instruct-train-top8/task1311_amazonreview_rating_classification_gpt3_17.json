I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

She loved the boots and worn them a few times. Within the first month of wear - worn only a few times - the seam on the right boot came completely out. Now she is afraid to wear them since she is worried the entire boot is going to split at the seam. She has worn them so few times, there isn't even wear on the bottom. Horrible quality for the high price. \n Rating: 1",

The pattern is just printed on, as opposed to being woven, so the inside of the shirt has that white/washed-out look to it, and doesn't match the outside of the shirt. It's also a bit itchy. I may have paid $5 for this shirt if I saw it on a shelf but I certainly wouldn't have paid $18.99. I'll probably send it back, honestly. \n Rating: 2",

But there is a very strong alcohol smell when you open up the individual pack.
