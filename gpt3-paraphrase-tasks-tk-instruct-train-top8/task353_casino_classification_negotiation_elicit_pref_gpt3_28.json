    "Definition": [
        "The input is taken from a negotiation between two campsite neighbors who are negotiating for Food, Water, and Firewood packages. Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances, output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The elicit-pref strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",

            "output": "Yes",
