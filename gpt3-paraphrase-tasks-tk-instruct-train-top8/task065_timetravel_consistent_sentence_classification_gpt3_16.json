        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You will then be given 2 options to choose from to fill in the second sentence. You need to select the option that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If the first option is correct, indicate your answer with 'Option 1'. Otherwise, if the second option is correct, indicate your answer with 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
