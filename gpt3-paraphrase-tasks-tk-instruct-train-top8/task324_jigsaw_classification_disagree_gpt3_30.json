        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from online platforms. You will need to classify the comment into one of two classes: agree or disagree. A comment should be classified as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. A comment should be classified as agree if it is not likely to raise any of the aforementioned types of disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

            "explanation": "The comment relates to politics but expresses a reasonable opinion that is likely to be agreed by the majority, despite their political beliefs. Thus, it is unlikely to raise public disagreement."

My impression is the reverse, that the media are more likely to treat Muslim violence as a product of Islam, and white violence as the result of mental imbalance. And many expect Muslim clerics to apologize for Muslim violence, but we don't expect the same of Christian clerics. We seem to believe what we want to believe. How do we resolve this?",

Faith based organizations provide important services to our society and they are to be commended for doing so. It simply does not follow that just because a faith based institution refuses to provide something that is contrary to that faith that in turn it should be forced out of business entirely and in the process punish those who receive the much needed other services provided by the institution. That would be perverse.",
