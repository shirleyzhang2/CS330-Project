        "Given a context and a verb separated by a newline character, you have to answer whether the given verb can be anchored in time or not. A verb can be anchored in time if it happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future. Output \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time and \"No\" otherwise."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "This is a good example. The \"invite\" is not anchorable. Although NATO decided to invite them, they haven't invited them yet, and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. They might change their decision later."

            "output": "No",
            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
