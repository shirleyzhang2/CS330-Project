        "In this task, you are given a tuple of Head and Tail events. The Head is a short phrase involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. The Tail is a feeling that may result from the Head event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head event, PersonY or others would feel the emotion mentioned in the Tail. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
