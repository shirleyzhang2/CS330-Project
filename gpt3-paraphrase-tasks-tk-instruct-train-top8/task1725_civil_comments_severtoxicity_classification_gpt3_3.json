Certainly the larger areas like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Soldotna already have sufficient state offices to handle a couple legislators taking up residence.\n\nThe one point I disagree with you on though is expanding the legislature. We've tried measures, including cutting the session from 121 to 90 days to put them back in communities, instead they dither and run up special sessions. Why add more opinions and conflict in, while increasing costs to the public?",

Anyone can apply for a license to start a liquor store and I'm sure the state would happily accept if all criteria were met and there were enough potential to support one. One thing our state does very well is find ways to extort more and more money out of us under the guise of helping schools, public services and whatever else the can conjure.\nAs much as I hate the state having sole control over liquor sales, the ballot measure proposed will be far worse in terms of selection and pricing.\nI don't believe the state will accept losing hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue which means they are either going to over tax liquor, as our friends in Washington have experienced, or they will find a way to spread it out by increasing taxes across the board.",

The issue of custody. The rest was just wasting space, and giving it a slant against Schnitzer.\nAnd I don't know these people at all, so I'm saying this with little knowledge of who they are.",
