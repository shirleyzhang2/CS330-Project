As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "explanation": "The overall sentiment of the review is positive as the reviewer refers to the dvd with positive expressions such as 'good piece of work', 'excellent' etc. The right label should be 'POS' and not 'NEG'."

The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime.  There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point.  They have decided to make the anime and movie more \"real\" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be \"realistic\" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.    The music and animation are excellent.  But I would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie",

The sex scenes aren't really the focal point of the movie -- it merely establishes the setting for our protagonists, Jay and Claire. The story becomes quite intriguing as Jay decides that he wants more than just anonymous weekly romp with Claire. Acting by Timothy Spall is excellent as usual. He is awesome in serious roles",

The lecture volume swings from low to extremely distorted and at times cannot be heard much at all. It was very disappointing considering the price and during the lecture Will Henry had slides that he presents with use of a laser pointer and you have no idea of what he is really showing to you or pointing to on those slides which are also barely legible on the video. My advice would be to pass on this one it isnt worth the time it takes to watch even if you got it for free.",

Well, I watched this movie on cable a couple of times when I was still a child, and I remember it being a good but forbidden movie. I decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic. But watching it as an adult has shown me one thing: it's bad in every way. From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with  consentual desire already. I guess my changing view about Zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old.    Bottom Line: No wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it",
