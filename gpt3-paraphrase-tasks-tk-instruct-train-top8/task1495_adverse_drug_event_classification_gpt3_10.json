        "In this task, you are given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE. Your task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event. An adverse drug reaction is a harmful or unpleasant reaction resulting from the use of a medical product."
