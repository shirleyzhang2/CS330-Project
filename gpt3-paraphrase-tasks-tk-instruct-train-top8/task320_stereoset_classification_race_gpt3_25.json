    "Definition": [
        "Given a target race and two sentences, your task is to determine whether the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. If the sentences and targets are unrelated, it means there is no relevance between them."
