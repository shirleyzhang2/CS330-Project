            "input": "You just linked to a complaint (not a court case, a complaint - there is a huge difference) by a guy trying to not pay his taxes.  Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

The organization acknowledges that first people also enjoy having the wild ducks and the importance the species has in the habitat. Second, that all can enjoy ducks by either viewing them or hunting them or both. Ducks Unlimited acknowledges that to view, hunt or enjoy both one has to have ducks to look at or eat. Ducks Unlimited has a main focus and that is to raise awareness and money needed to maintain duck habitat and to educate the public about the habitat that is needed to keep ducks living and reproducing.  Hunting is also a conservation tool that is used to manage a species. My opinion is that wildlife can be managed successfully in Alaska for all the user groups and is because all the groups share one thing in common, the use of our wildlife in a wise way that will insure that needed habitat is maintained and a certain number of healthy animals remain in that habitat.
