I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

It has done the complete opposite. It has dried out my hands and left them looking scaly - literally! This was after about a week of using it. It has also left my hands so dry that I am snagging my clothing when I have to put clothes on or adjust them, especially nylons. I am sending it back. I'll go back to my previous hand lotion, which never left them dry. I just tried this because it supposedly had healthier ingredients and didn't leave a greasy residue.",

I am really tired of having to return these lights because it does cost for me to return them. I don't understand why they just quit working because one day they are working and the next day they are not. When they do work, they look great, but having some light and others not light does not look good. I am thinking about returning the three that quit working, but I am just tired of returning them.",

The main issue was the massive wait for shipping. Granted, I was notified that the shipping would take longer than usual, but the overall wait time was ridiculous. They first missed the estimated date of arrival, then notified me of the wait, THEN they arrived, and when they arrived, they were 10 days (!) from expiration (and if I'm not mistaken, these have a shelf life of about 3 months). The people shipping these need to get it together. Please make sure with the seller first when they are arriving, AND expiring!",

Cushions are not as dense (same height) seat back is more upright--I want relaxation on my swing. My old cushions actually reversed, these do not. The fabric is higher quality, will probably last longer, canopy almost fits (never did on the old one, and replacement was worse), side tables are a nice feature. I wish I had never bought it, especially since it was so expensive. I paid a handyman $100 to put it together to discover this--would have to pay another $$ to take it apart, cannot return it, stuck with something I don't like.",
