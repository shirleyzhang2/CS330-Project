    "Definition": [
        "The input for this task is taken from a negotiation between two people who are pretending to be neighbors who are negotiating for packages of food, water, and firewood. Given an utterance and the recent dialogue context containing the past 3 utterances (if available), output \"Yes\" if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output \"No\". The self-need strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy where the person tries to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation, such as by pointing out that they sweat a lot to show preference towards water packages."

'Yes, it would.' 'I think that sounds fair. The problem is that there are 3 waters and one of us would get two and the other one. How should we sort that?'\nUtterance: 'You can take the two water. I am not that thirsty most days.'",
