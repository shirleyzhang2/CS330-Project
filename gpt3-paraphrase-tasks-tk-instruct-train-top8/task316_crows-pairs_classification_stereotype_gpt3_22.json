        "In this task, you are given a short passage that conveys a stereotype or an anti-stereotype. A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people(based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, abilities, etc.). An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to output 'stereotype' or 'anti-stereotype', depending on which the passage is."
