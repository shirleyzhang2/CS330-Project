I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you.",

Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity.",
