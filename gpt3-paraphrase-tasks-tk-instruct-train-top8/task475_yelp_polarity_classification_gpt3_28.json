Hao Bao and Sandra Dee's were camped out in their usual Thursday night spot next to JAM, a boutique in the Old Town area Scottsdale.\\n\\nI ordered the Dumplings and the Street Treats.\\n\\nThe Street Treats... \\n\\naheaheweqejxfdaserwrns h gxasedagd\\n\\n... sorry, my keyboard shorted from me drooling in remembrance.  Marinated and seared to perfection, they were savory and ever so slightly spicy.  I could make a whole meal around just them.  At $4 a pop for an order, they are worth every cent, and that's saying a lot given this economy!\\n\\nThe dumplings were good, if a tad underseasoned.  They had been steamed and then seared as any proper potsticker should be, but had a limp feel to them.   Also, they didn't come with any of the traditional soy/scallion dipping sauces that generally accompany dumplings. The order of 6 was $7.  A tad over priced given what I got and should probably be in the $5-6 range.\\n\\nI was also disappointed that, given a name like Hao Bao,  they didn't actually serve the steamed bun Bao that I'd been so eager to try.\\n\\nAll that being said, I would visit them again (and will be tomorrow night) as I'd like to try their Scallion Pancakes and the Noodle Soup.\\n\\nGive them a shot, but don't expect any Bao with your Hao.",

I have only been here a few times, but have never been disappointed.  I have tried an array of sub shops in my time and I can honestly say that this is one of the better ones.  The menu boasts a wide variety of subs and toppings including a Vegetarian menu, if you are in to that, but what separates it from most places is their emphasis on the Cheese Steak and their generous portions of meat.  Most shops around here tend to be a little lean on the meat and they more than compensate you for your dollar.  A regular does me just fine, but for those of a more carnivorous nature, they also have their Ultra menu which gives you double the meat if not more.  Another thing that i find refreshing is their Shoestring french fries, that they provide you with as a side if you dine in extra if you take out.  They also offer a Chicken Cheese Steak, which is also difficult to find in most shops.  Drink wise, they offer a variety of craft soda, craft beer, and of course your fountain.  Refills are extra. \\n\\nOnto the Service.  In all honesty it can be a little hit or miss.  I have gone and have had great service where my food is ready and brought out immediately and there have been times where I have sat and waited a bit too long.  Having worked in food service I understand that it isn't perfect every time, but generally the wait is worth with it.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant is Cash Only.\\n\\nIf anyone is looking for a sub shop with character and delicious hoagies I would highly recommend it.  If subs aren't your thing the \\\"\"Burgatory\\\"\" and \\\"\"Panera Bread\\\"\" are next door.",

            "input": "First off, I want to say that they do not lie about being in and out within a hour. They dont hassle you like other dealers in town. Just know there is no room for negotiation. The price is set. Our sales guy was very nice. The only reason I give this a two star is because they did not properly do a thorough inspection. After we took the car for a test drive, I noticed that the break, radiator and windshield fluid were low. When I told the Kurt, our sales guy that it was low he said that it was because the car needs to be running. When we brought the car home we did a more thorough inspection of the car and found that they did not change the air filter and cabin filter. It was really dirty. Other things that they did not do was top off the gas and remove the tree sap that was all over the car. Dont get me wrong, I love the 2010 Subaru Outback that I purchased from them, but they couldve done minor things to make this more pleasant.\\n\\nI called the service department at the dealership after the inspection and they wanted us to take it in. Since they were on the other town and they dont really do anything special for you when you buy the car, it wouldve been a waste of time and extra money out of my pocket to fill up my tank. \\n\\nOverall, they get a two star for the lack of service I believe they place on cars that they put on that lot. At least, that is what I found when I purchased the car.\\n\\nOne more thing is that the sticker that they place on the windshield that tells you when the next oil change is up was not updated. I called them and they advised that it was changed, but not updated. Not a big deal, but get it right next time guys. They also added tons of miles on the car while they had it. They had the contract at 23,582, but we actually got it with 23,780. Someone must've been taking it for a ride before it got placed on the lot. I don't know if it makes a difference but we shouldve had them update the contracts with the correct mileage. Wonder if it wouldve changed the price a little. OH WELL. Lesson learned.",

I enjoy the comfortable seats but service will be keeping me away. \\n\\nI have had cold popcorn delivered to me, and red wine when I ordered white. One time I ordered a bottle of wine and received an open bottle with wine missing. Bartenders are overwhelmed easily and the bar is often filthy when any guests are present. The quality of food isn't worthy of the experience. \\n\\nI don't expect much from this place anymore which is sad. They have so much potential if they would take their service seriously.",

Not Oyshi!\\nThankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.\\n\\nThe All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. \\n\\nI think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.\\n\\nI do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.\\n\\nThe alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.\\n\\nOn a positive note, Dana is not a huge sushi fan, so she opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, she had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables. It was a fantastic deal!",
