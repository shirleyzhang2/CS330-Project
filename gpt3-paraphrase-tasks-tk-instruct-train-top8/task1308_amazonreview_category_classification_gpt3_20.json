I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again.

My daughter liked it so she kept using it as a nightlight (the original one I purchased), not as an alarm which I intended, and even then it stopped working completely and would not charge by month 3-4.
