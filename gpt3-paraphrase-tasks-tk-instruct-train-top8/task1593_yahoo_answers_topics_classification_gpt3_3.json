Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering.  As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades.  The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions.",

We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.    Given our current rate of deepening understanding, we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years, but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute \"proof\"",

Since you asked \"how the human species evolved?\" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for \"fit\" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology.",
