    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). You need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. self-need is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation, such as by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages."
