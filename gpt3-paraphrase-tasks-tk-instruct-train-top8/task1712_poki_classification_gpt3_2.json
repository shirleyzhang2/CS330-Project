        "You are given a short poem written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school based on the poem. Kids in elementary school are in 1st to 6th grade, and kids in high school are in 7th to 12th grade. There are only two possible outputs, elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output, and no input can have both outputs at the same time."
