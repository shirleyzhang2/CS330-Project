I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

They went in and changed the prices on all of that one week after my order. I will never order from Amazon again.... they also would not give me a refund on a product that I had ordered and only gave me a gift card with Amazon instead of putting it back into my account... \n Rating: 2",
