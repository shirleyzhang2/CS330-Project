\" asks john .\nhe 's also surprised at the variety of items\nbeatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty - pound block of cheese .\n\"\nthe freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it 's not supposed to be used for everything .\nthat 's why it 's smaller than the refrigerator .\n\"\nit 's something most of us find strangely familiar .\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur .\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep 's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion .\nwhen they 're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside !\n\"\nyou do n't know what the joke was because you could n't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context .\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene .\ni do n't want to give them away , but suffice it to\nsay they work just as well as they have in the past .\njohn 's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him .\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth .\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way .\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character\n: you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world .\nin a way , he 's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude .\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect .\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it 's hard to get mad at her character .\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her .\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer 's disease .\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely .\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother 's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama 's boy .\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes .\na solid connection is not really made between john 's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother .\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ?\n: beatrice : you must think i 'm some kind of moron .\njohn\n: no , i think your someone who thinks i 'm a moron .\nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one .",

restoring properties .\nsound pretty heavy ?\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film 's constant barrage of humor .\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him\n( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , can not avoid looking at .\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good .\nsince they 've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean - luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard 's trademark , with his usual aplomb .\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android - wishing - to - be - human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .\ndespite many other critics ' negative opinions , f .\nmurray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough .\nru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .\nlike the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .\nru'afro is no khan from star trek ii -- the best trek villain ever -- but he is much better than the forgettable dr .\nsoran from star trek : generations .\n( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . )\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with .\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with .\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .\na particular plot point involving anij 's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection 's special effects were surprisingly disappointing .\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior does n't look quite right for a reason i can not explain .\ndespite star trek : insurrection 's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film .\nit maintains roddenberry 's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , do n't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .\ni 'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .\nrated pg , i ca n't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .",
