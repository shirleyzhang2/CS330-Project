    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a sentence, and you will need to determine if it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Classify your answers into overruling or non-overruling."
