    "Definition": [
        "You will be given a pair of words. You need to deduce the type of relationship between them. The types of relations are 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. 'HYPER' means that the first word is a specific instance of the second word. 'COORD' means that the first word and the second word belong to the same semantic class. If neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
