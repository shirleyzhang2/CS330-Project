            "input": "\tOptical mice use an LED and a camera to rapidly\ncapture images of the surface beneath the mouse.\nThe infomation from the camera is analyzed by a\nDSP (Digital Signal Processor) and used to detect\nimperfections in the underlying surface and\ndetermine motion. Some materials, such as glass,\nmirrors or other very shiny, uniform surfaces\ninterfere with the ability of the DSP to\naccurately analyze the surface beneath the mouse.\n\\nSince glass is transparent and very uniform, the\nmouse is unable to pick up enough imperfections in\nthe underlying surface to determine motion.\nMirrored surfaces are also a problem, since they\nconstantly reflect back the same image, causing\nthe DSP not to recognize motion properly. When the\nsystem is unable to see surface changes associated\nwith movement, the mouse will not work properly.",

Become secure in what type of person you are and what you want, so when the person comes along you will recognize them. Hang out in the kind of places your soul mate might be---meetings or clubs having to do with your hobbies or work, places of religion if you are religious, online dating sites, etc. Ultimately, I believe it comes down to who you are and what you project about yourself. Don't put on a front, be your true self, and eventually you and your soul mate will find each other. I followed what I've written here and it worked for me. My husband and I are truly soul mates and have been married a little over three years now. (Incidently, we met on the internet.:)) The poem \"Waiting\", in the link below, was my motto during the years I was seeking my soul mate.",

It had been celebrated by Pagans for centuries, but the emperor moved it to this later date.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, the Church Fathers likewise set the official date for celebrating the birth of Jesus as being December the 25th.\\n\\nThe Italians today commemorate Christmas for an entire month. Just as in the days of Pagan Rome with Saturnalia, the period between mid-December and early January is one constant celebration.\\n\\nRich Nativity scenes and the playing of bagpipes by the zampognari (shepards) are very important to the look and feel of Christmas in Italy.",
