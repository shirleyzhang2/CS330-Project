The examination included a TA of 170/95 mmHg, dyspnea with a respiratory rate of 20 rpm and auscultation with bilateral wheezing and crackling in bases. Tachyarrhythmia at 110 bpm. Discrete malleolar edemas. What is the approach to follow? \n Options:  <0> The patient probably has pneumonia and the priority is to perform a chest X-ray to confirm it. <1> It is probably an exacerbation of your COPD due to respiratory overinfection. Reinforce the basic treatment with an inhaled beta-2, corticoids and antibiotics and monitor evolution. <2> You probably have a component of left heart failure associated with a febrile respiratory infection. It would be a priority to treat it with vasodilators and diuretics in addition to the treatment that corresponds to their respiratory infection, bronchodilators, etc. <3> The patient is not classified for the severity of his COPD, which would indicate an immediate spirometry to adjust the treatment to the severity of the obstruction. It would also associate an antibiotic given the apparent picture of respiratory overinfection. <4> An echocardiogram would be the first exploration to be performed to rule out a possible component of heart failure associated with the exacerbated COPD episode presented by the patient.",
