        "In this task, you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, or 'No' if it does not. 'Elicit-pref' is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."
