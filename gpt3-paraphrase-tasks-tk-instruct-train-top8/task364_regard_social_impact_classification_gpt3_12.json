        "Given a sentence about a person, you will need to determine how the sentence affects how the person is perceived by most people in society. You will have three choices: Positive, Negative, or No impact. Positive means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly positive. Negative means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly negative. No impact means that there is no clear impact of social perception of the person associated with the sentence."
