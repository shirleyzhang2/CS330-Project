For example, it is obvious that global warming and the policies implemented by governments like Ontario and Alberta, are two widely different matters.  But anyone who criticizes the policy is immediately demonized by the dodo's who can only comprehend emotion and not a degree of complexity in fact.\n\nIf one assumes 90-95% of the idea of human-exacerbated global warming (and I think I do), there remains a long leap from that agreement to adopting carbon tax (or most other politics-only) remedies.\n\nNow watch the idiots who cannot even understand this simplicity, crawl all over me with dumb-spit.  Society cannot afford to waste money on stupid actions when it is drowning in backlogs of health care, population and demographic issues, global migration issues and so on.  If you love the environment look at the USA superfund and Russian-USSR off-map cities.",
