        "In this task, you will be shown an English sentence. Your task is to classify the sentence as either a correct representation of an anaphor number agreement, or as an incorrect representation. Anaphor number agreement is a restriction where a phrase agrees with the preceeding expression: plurals match plurals or singular expressions match singular expressions. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match in plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match."
