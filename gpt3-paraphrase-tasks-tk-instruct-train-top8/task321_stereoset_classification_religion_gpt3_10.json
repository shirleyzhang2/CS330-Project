        "You will be given two sentences about stereotypes of religions. You need to determine if the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated to the first sentence with respect to the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
