    "Definition": [
        "You are given a prompt and two completions from a language model. Your task is to select the completion that is more topical with respect to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is considered topical if the completion maintains relevance and logical succession with the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
