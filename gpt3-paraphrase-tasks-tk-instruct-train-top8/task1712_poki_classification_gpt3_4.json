        "You are given a short poem. Your task is to predict if the poem's author is in elementary school or high school. Poems written by kids in grades 1-6 will be considered as elementary school poems, and those written by kids in grades 7-12 will be considered as high school poems. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output, and no input will have both outputs."
