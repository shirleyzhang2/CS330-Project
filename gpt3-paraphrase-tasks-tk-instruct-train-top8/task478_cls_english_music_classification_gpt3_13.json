I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

I bought this album around seven or eight years ago when I was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse. Because my personal dwelling space was so small, I wanted to create an illusion that my place was big, spacious and open and I did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories, but by creating  a \"big atmosphere\" through the music I chose to play when I had guests over.    Whenever I played this CD at dinner parties I threw, people literally stopped and noticed the music. I had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated, but for the most part, people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can.    What I'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart, a lot of soul, a lot of punch for the buck. If you find yourself listening to the same old music, you might just want to pick up this CD and expose yourself to something so cool, it's hot",

The CD has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when I put the CD into my pc yet then I realised throughout every minute of the CD it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it, this is where the CD'S charm lies in it's bubble gum pop punk rock. It's fun, it's lighthearted it's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ If you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly, which is also nice they included the DVD with it so you can see the videos which show off the band's true vision.    If you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk, or something completly differnt, then you found it. Who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme, sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album?",

            "input": "One of the worst bands of all time! . Alright, I will state that I was curious about this band about four years ago. I thought to myself: \"Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte.\" Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as \"emo with estrogen\". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.    They are a whiny band that love to sing about how \"horrible\" and \"tragic\" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's \"deep\" and \"inspiring\" so-called \"music\". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the \"pop-punk\" and \"emo\" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.    Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that \"GC\" are musical gods or are the \"best punk rawk band eva!111!1!\", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are \"old\" and \"horrible\". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like \"XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX\" and \"trU3_pUnk_raWk3r\".    Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:    Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands.  Kid #2: Where did you hear them first?  Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.    Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month?  Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!    Teenybopper talking to herself: \"Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee\"    Ugh.    In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:    Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges  Ramones - The Ramones  London Calling - The Clas",

Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine \"greatest hits\" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is \"Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun\" etc etc etc? The albums \"Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back\" as well as \"Live at the El Mocambo\" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did.
