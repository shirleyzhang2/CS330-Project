        "You will be given a question. You need to output which category the question falls into. The categories are \"Description\", \"Entity\", \"Abbreviation\", \"Person\", \"Quantity\", and \"Location\". A question belongs in the \"Description\" category if it asks about description and abstract concepts. Entity questions are about entities such as animals, colors, sports, etc. Abbreviation questions ask about abbreviations and expressions abbreviated. Questions regarding human beings, description of a person, and a group or organization of persons are categorized as \"Human\". \"Quantity\" questions are asking about numeric values and \"Location\" questions ask about locations, cities, and countries."
