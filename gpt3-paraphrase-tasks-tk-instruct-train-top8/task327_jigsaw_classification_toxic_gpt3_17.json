Your idea is tolerant if, and only if, part of that idea is that you have to tolerate me and my ideas. It's a very simple quod-pro-quo calculation. I must tolerate your views even if I disagree with them - as long as you do the same for me. If your view is that I should be cut into tiny little pieces and fed to the dogs, I'm not obligated to tolerate that view. If your view is that I should not be allowed to express my views - then I'm not obligated to tolerate that view and I am justified to prevent you expressing it so that all the many other views can remain safe to express.",
