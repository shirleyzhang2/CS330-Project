What does that have to do with anything? \n\nAs with most things, you decide subjectively that X = hate and then scoff at anyone who asks you to actually defend that position. Way more stories on this site about illegal immigrants killing citizens than there are stories about cops shooting people, but saying \"illegal immigrants are importing crime into our country\" is racist because \"not all,\" but you'll turn around and villify all cops as \"fascist thugs.\" It's always this way with uber-sensitive, overly politicized people like you. The same sort of person that called Obama a socialist Kenyan now calls Trump a \"xenophobic racist.\" It's all hyperbolic nonsense but in the mind of someone like you anyone who points out your silliness is a \"socialist,\" or a \"Nazi\" depending on which color tie your candidate wears. It's incredible to me that you can even function day to day with this going on inside your head.",

They have had every Native from around the area on telling us all what a wonderful community member the deceased is.  I remember the day after it happened, they had the brother on for about 5 minutes telling the native side of the story, the mother has been on telling how bad the Police were.......yada yada yada.........and this case is just making it to court now.  How is our Public Broadcaster allowed to use our tax dollars to interfere and again, try to influence public opinion- giving only one side of the story?   And it is a case before the courts, normally that  was a no go area for media.....apparently not anymore.",
