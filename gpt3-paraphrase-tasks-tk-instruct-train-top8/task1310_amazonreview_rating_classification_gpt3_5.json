I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

Negatives: the separate baggies for the backings, backings feel kind of cheap. I haven't tested them against the rigors of children playing, but I may not even try without gluing them given the problems other people have had. I'm giving three stars because these will work just fine for what I want them for (mostly cutesy gifts for grown-ups).",

He has the Catboy costume as well. The quality of each is ok. The velcro in the back sticks to the material easily and causes pilling. With that being said, I would still purchase these all over again considering how much he loves them. A little pilling on the back is nothing when I hear him happily playing.",

First review:Very bright! Looks to be well made. It's a good deal for sure. 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger! Wow.",
