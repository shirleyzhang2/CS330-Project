        "In this task, you are given a tuple consisting of a Head and a Tail event, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving one or more participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others feel what is mentioned in the Tail. Feelings in this task are the emotional reactions on the part of PersonY or other participants in an event. For example, as a result of gift-giving, others (in this case, PersonY) might feel appreciated. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
