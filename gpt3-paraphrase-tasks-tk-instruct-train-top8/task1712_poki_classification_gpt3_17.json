        "You are given a short poem which is written by a kid. Your task is to predict if the kid is in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from grade 1st to 6th-grade will be considered as in elementary school, and 7th to 12th-grade kids will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs have at least one output and it cannot have both categories at a time."
