        "Given a public comment from online platforms, you are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

We weren't a good fit and my ex-wife was more interested in my \"resources\" and what they afforded her to do than being a contributing partner in our relationship. The divorce cost me about $40,000 and I have paid a total of $432,000 in child and spousal support during this time as she has remarried TWICE. When I initiated the split she told me she would take me for everything and continues to do so to this day. In the mean time I focused on living in my tiny house and trying to be the best dad to my kids. Both have completely pulled away from me in their teens because I have insisted on them going to school and having responsibilities. Their mother has been entirely hands off. She parties, rides her horses while I struggle to convince my kids to improve attendance at school, avoid weed, and work hard. They won't listen. It's been hell. Why would I want to go through this again?. It's been financial devastation.",

It's the voice of the people, letting the elites know that things are changing.\n\nThe political elites think they are special snowflakes who can do what they want. They have forgotten that they have duties, obligations and responsibilities to the people, not to the special interests and lobbyists.\n\nIf you want someone to blame for this chant blame Notley for breaking her promises to the voters. Blame Notley for catering to special interests instead of the people.  You can condemn it all you want, like you condemned Trump, but you can't stop what's coming.  The only way to stop it is to start governing for the benefit of the people instead of the special interests.",

When a president elect yells at a reporter that his station is fake news [CNN] and refuses to answer the questions, we wonder if we are not in a modern 1933 Germany, when Hitler stopped most of the press. Right now, more than ever, we need a press that questions, investigates, reports on the actions of this shyster, more than ever. Please do not succumb to his tirades. Please continue to report the news as it is presented. Please continue to question and make this man  and his republican cabinet accountable. God bless America.",

And all other victims of sexual abuse.   The message you sent to those victims was that they were not worth protecting,  that you support the predators over them.  You sent a powerful message to other predators too.  You implied what they do is okay with you.  You took measures to show support for them.  Under the law.  What you did was to make Alaska a predator friendly state.   The rights of those suffering from child sexual abuse are not negotiable.  Ever.",
