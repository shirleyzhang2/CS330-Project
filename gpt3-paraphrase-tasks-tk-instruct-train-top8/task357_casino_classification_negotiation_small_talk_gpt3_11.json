        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (whenever available). The task is to output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in order to build a rapport with the opponent."
