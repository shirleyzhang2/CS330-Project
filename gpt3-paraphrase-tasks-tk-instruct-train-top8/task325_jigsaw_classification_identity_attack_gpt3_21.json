And all that would hurt are the people who would be deprived of their priestly ministry. The bishops do not give a sh#7 about their priests or their people - there are very few I would consider even remotely connected to the Good Shepherd. \n\nHonestly, I do not see the macho/heterosexual brawny culture that Fr Reese references in the article. Quick the contrary, bishops running around with their  boy-toy sycophants. Talk about a gay culture. Of course all that sexual energy is tied up into the exercise (sometimes brutal) of power and an affinity for raising large sums of money for their special projects.",

The loathsome Trump is in a position where he will be able to personally profit from the office and, as long as the Republican dominated Congress remains mute, can likely be very difficult to stop.\n\nWith Citizens' United attracting massive amounts of cash to politics, more rich men will be attracted by the allure of potential profit from the office of president.\n\nFor the health of the system, hopefully organization like the ACLU will be able to compel  disclose of Trump's financial conflicts.  Perhaps his greed will lead to the House being so shamed that his corruption will lead to impeachment.\n\nAnd I wonder if he is charging the federal government for its use of Mara Largo?  And how much?",
