            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",

They were taken away just like a white persons baby would be taken away if they could not care for it.  \n\nNow years later the \u201csurvivors\u201d are going to get compensation because of their unfit mothers and families.

Justin Trudeau brought the Liberal Party back from 3rd place to  power and recruited a lot of bright,accomplished people albeit some with very little political experience especially of the go for the throat school of Rove in which many of the CPC members are steeped.\n\nTrudeau has degrees from  2  great universities, Mcgill and UBC and is widely read and traveled.\n\nThe leader of the opposition has a BA and few months training as an insurance salesman. Many CPC MP's  went directly into back room politics from high school or university.\n\n Thee is nothing wrong with any of his of course but to then blather on about Trudeau  not being up to the mark is comic considering the source.\n\nThere has probably never been as weak and undistinguished a cabinet  as Harpers and Scheers \"shadow cabinet\" is about the same.",

We hate the niqab and burqa too but realise that they will not disappear with a ban. The only thing Europe has succeeded in doing with their bans is to further ghettoise and isolate the Muslim communities, which makes it easier for radicalisation. Things change by having subsequent generations integrate more into mainstream and secular society, something that Canada does fairly well. It's slow (a matter of generations) but effective, particularly since we do not have nowhere near the same level of influx Europe has.",
