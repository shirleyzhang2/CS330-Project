            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

She's bitchy, snide and her responses to the most simple of events is weirdly inappropriate. In the very first scene, this 30 year old ph.D stumbles across her parents having sex and completely freaks out, so much so that she violently (but oh, so amusingly...) attacks them both. Time for little Fred to grow up, I think. The mystery is too easily solved and the men in her life, both instantly, and for no apparent reason, falling in love with her, are simple stereotypes of the gorgeous but smitten male. The first in a series, It seems likely that she'll soon be having a lot of sex with both of them; and simple, brainless pornography is about the best I can hope for from this ridiculous book",

And once they teach you which of their magic proprietary indicators to keep an eye on, guess what?  You're supposed to sign up for a subscription to get them, not even the simplest of the data is available free althought the book implies they are.

It just like when Americans have a cocaine problem, it is the US government, and not the drug smugglers and dealers, that has the responsibility.  And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know.  At least that's Herman's view.  Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves.  Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China.  They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a \"premier\" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques.  If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow?  No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss.  When historians condemn these two for their \"crime\" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly.  And so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the Scots don't even have a country they can call their own while the \"barbaric\" and \"decadent\" Chinese do",

My impression was much that of another Amazon reader. It is at times a vivid account of a new immigrant experience, but the tale is not told with the deepest intensity of feeling. It may be unfair but the comparison which comes to mind is with Henry Roth's \"Call it Sleep\" which is a fictional work but one which goes deep into the soul and consciousness. This work is a more externally directed narrative, and has its virtue in giving a picture of one person's move to the New World",

A pivotal look at the development of Latin American popular music, novelist Alejo Carpentier's historical tract was originally published in 1946, and came out of raging, decades-long intellectual debates about the nature of Cuban and Latin American culture.  This is the first English translation of this work and includes a lengthy introductory essay by the editor, explaining the author's role in the Cuban intelligensia... &quot;Music In Cuba&quot; was an attempt to settle some of the controversies about the &quot;legitimacy&quot; of Cuban music, and to resolve the apparent differences between tony, Europhilic art music and the grittier rural style that came to dominate the island's popular imagination.  It's an intellectual, somewhat egghead-y book, but rich in cultural depth... The new foreward is also very valuable, giving proper context to Carpentier and his work, and a sense of the academic and philosophical life of Cubans abroad and at home in the early 20th Century",
