In addition to The Black Obelisk and The Night in Lisbon, he also wrote about Robert and Otto selling their auto workshop and visiting Patrice in a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium in his novel The Three Comrades, while the turbulent life of the German surgeon Ravic is told in The Arch of Triumph. Another of his novels, The Road Back, is thought to be a sequel to his most famous book, in which the patriotic teacher Kantorek convinces Paul Bumer and his friends to join the Germany Army during World War I. For 10 points, name this German author who wrote All Quiet on the Western Front.",

After losing a governor's race to Pat Brown, this politician erroneously said the press wouldn't have him to kick around anymore. In another election, this man defended his use of a slush fund with the \"\"Checkers\"\" speech. For 10 points, name this former Vice President under Eisenhower, who lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, but eventually was elected president in 1968.",

            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke. Following World War II, this artist produced such collections as Mormon Villages and The Irish Countryman, and her report with her husband Paul Taylor led to her employment by Roy Stryker, who had hired Esther Bubley for similar reasons. Her work was used in an exhibit on Executive Order 9066, but she remains better known for a work whose title figure remained unknown for forty years until she identified herself as Florence Owens Thompson, a portrait produced as the result of her hiring by the Farm Security Administration. For ten points, identify this photographer who produced some of the most famous images of the Great Depression, including Migrant Mother.",

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",

            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."

Its author believes that one can never know the empirical ego, since the mind can only experience itself through filtered perception, the transcendental ego. This work posits a phenomenal and a noumenal world, the latter of which is unknowable. It argues that the mind uses twelve categories, including causality, to interpret and impose order on the world, and claims that a priori knowledge can be either analytic or synthetic. For 10 points, name this work by Immanuel Kant, the first of his Critiques.",

That ninth man with this name became a \"prisoner\" after his city was captured by Victor Emmanuel II and also defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary.

The melody of one section, which features a glass armonica, is played by the flute, backed by the strings, on top of glissando-like runs in the piano. The first piano plays a descending ten-on-one ostinato, while the second plays a six-on-one. Another section in this piece marked Allegro Pomposo utilizes a quotation from the Incidental Music of Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while a double-bass plays a theme from \"Dance of the Slyphs. \" Yet another one instructs performers to \"imitate the gaucheries of a novice,\" and thus suggests the fumbling tyro of scales by slowing down during tricky parts and speeding up at the end. The next movement borrows heavily from various sources including one of the composer's own works, Rossini's The Barber of Seville, and \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. \" Forbidding this piece's performance during his lifetime, and including movements called \"the Pianists,\" \"Fossils\" and \"The Swan,\" for 10 points, name this \"grand zoological fantasy\" composed by Camille Saint-Saens.",

The symmetry number is an overcounting correction factor that appears along with some power of the rotation temperature in the denominator for ones representing rotational energies. Its value for a system composed of several subsystems equals the product of its values for the subsystems, which implies that the Helmholtz free energy is additive over subsystems since the Helmholtz free energy is proportional to its logarithm. This quantity can also be thought of as a normalization constant since it is simply the integral over all states of the degeneracy factor times e to the negative beta times the energy of that microstate. For 10 points, name this quantity whose \"canonical\" form simply equals the sum over states of Boltzmann factors, and describes the macroscopic properties of a thermodynamic system.",

His policies were opposed by such groups as Order and Freedom and Fatherland and Liberty, but enabled by the laissez-faire ethos of the \"Schneider Doctrine,\" which allowed his victory over Paper Manufacturer Jorge Alessandri to stand. Disturbances during this man's time in office include the El Teniente Copper strike and the rebellion of a tank regiment near the capital. His eventual successor replaced the loyal Carlos Prats as a member of this man's cabinet in August of 1973, one month before he would lead a coup against this man.
