            "input": "the central focus of michael winterbottom 's \" welcome to sarajevo \" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there .\nit proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( \" platoon \" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible \" the walking dead \" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( \" schindler 's list \" ) .\nthe two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false .\nthe question is not what went right .\nthe question is what went wrong .\nfor one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that 's about it . ) .\nthe assortment of high - profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter \" into \" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children 's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive .\nthe interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison .\nstill , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music .\nand it 's a plus , because he does n't toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness .\nhe wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious .\nthe sweet hereafter starring ian holm , sarah polley , bruce greenwood , tom mccamus , gabrielle rose , arsinee khanjian , alberta watson , maury chaykin , caerthan banks .\nproduced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg .\nscript by atom egoyan ( based on the novel by russell banks ) .\ndirected by atom egoyan .\nrunning time : 110 mins .\nrated r .\n_\n_\n_\n_\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ atom egoyan 's powerfully meditative \" the sweet hereafter \" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i 've seen this year .\nit not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected .\nian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he 's a lion for the wrong reasons :\nthe pain for having lost his daughter ( she 's a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town .\nand in\nsome mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity .\nit 's one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i 've ever seen .\nbut the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future .\nher ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near - revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for \" breaking the waves \" .\nboth women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love .\n\"\nthe sweet hereafter \" though , is atom egoyan 's movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema .\nafter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994 's \" exotica \" , \" the sweet hereafter \" makes him something\nfew people in this industry can call themselves : an artist .\nhe interweaves time with a delicacy and sees a soul with a purity that is just not common .",

            "input": "steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) .\nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino .\n\"\nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( ' everything being made now is crap ' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood .\nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman - wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned .\nhis accountant ( adam alexi - malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops .\nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america 's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star .\nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low - grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously .\nhe sends his cast members ( who are n't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co - stars ) to ramsey 's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance .\nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time .\nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self - help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities .\n( as if that 's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l. ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand - in .\nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff ,\nramsey 's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage .\nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself .\nfurthermore , consider the enemies he 'll make of popular scientologists .\npacing stricter 's neutral - coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly .\nmurphy 's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing .\n\"\nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin 's invention .\nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo - religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry .\n( the griffin mill - types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . )\nmartin 's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder 's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative - never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture .\nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin 's crew of mexican border - jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin 's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two - thousand dollars ( ! ) .\nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen .\nbowfinger 's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath .\nwe 're also asked to believe that a few simple close - ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z - grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush .\n( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz 's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . )\nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece .\nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham 's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom .\nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus\n: the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome .\nmartin gets sentimental by story 's end as he did in l. a. story , and how could he not ?\nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world .",
