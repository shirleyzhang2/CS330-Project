        "Given an utterance, which is a part of a conversation between a user and an agent, your task is to detect the speaker. The user usually commands the agent to schedule events, retrieve event information, and check the schedule. The agent's response is usually an answer to the user's questions or follow-up questions on the user's command. Output \"User\" or \"Agent\" to indicate which one is the speaker."
