These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

This set has some good story lines, and the pictures are clear and sound very good. My only complaint is the way they kept using the same actors and actresses all throughout these movies. Acting is very good though...but the sameness gets redundant and a bit boring. Some of the same lines are used, throughout the movies. I was born shortly after these movies were filmed, and I recall much of what appears in them...the building styles, furniture styles to some extent, and some of the clothing styles were still popular in the 1950's. ..I was a very young girl but I recall a lot of this. Brings back memories. Was a simpler life back then...slower, more easy going. People were nicer to one another and more polite. I miss that.",

I purchased this primarily to use as a landscape lens and had to throw away more than 2/3 of the images i captured with it due to flare and chromatic aberration. If you plan to use this indoors or for astrophotography, you will likely be very pleased. If you intend to use it in bright sunlight, you will likely be very disappointed. For me, it was not a keeper so I returned it.",

I was about to toss them into the Goodwill bin when I thought of shoe stretchers. After reading a number of reviews for various brands and types, I bought these. I followed the directions and now my boots fit perfectly. I recommend giving these stretchers a try before getting rid of $100+ leather boots or shoes that are too tight. Just be patient and follow the included instructions. I also appreciate the inclusion of a long shoehorn, all packaged in a convenient bag.",
