            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.

            "input": "Article: Bill Gates, the billionaire Microsoft chairman without a single earned university degree, is by his success raising new doubts about the worth of the business world's favorite academic title: the MBA (Master of Business Administration). The MBA, a 20thcentury product, always has borne the mark of lowly commerce and greed on the tree-lined campuses ruled by purer disciplines such as philosophy and literature. But even with the recession  apparently cutting down the hiring of business school graduates, about 79,000 people are expected to receive MBAs in 1993. This is nearly 16 times the number of business graduates in 1960. \"If you are going into the corporate world it is still a disadvantage not to have one,\" said Donald Morrison, professor of marketing and management science. \"But in the last five years or so, when someone says, 'Should I attempt to get an MBA?' the answer a lot more is: It depends.\" The success of Bill Gates and other non-MBAs, such as the late Sam Walton of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has helped inspire self-conscious debates on business school campuses over the worth of a business degree and whether management skills can be taught. The Harvard Business Review printed a lively, fictional exchange of letters to dramatize complaints about business degree holders. The article called MBA hires \"extremely disappointing\" and said \"MBAs want to move up too fast, they don't understand politics and people, and they aren't able to function as part of a team until their third year. But by then, they're out looking for other jobs.\" The problem, most participants in the debate acknowledge, is that the MBA has acquired an aura   of future riches and power far beyond its actual importance and usefulness. Business people who have hired or worked with MBAs say those with the degrees of ten know how to analyze systems but are not so skillful at motivating people. \"They don't get a lot of grounding in the people side of the business\", said James Shaffer, vice-president and principal of the Towers Perrin management consulting firm. \n Question: . It seems that the argument over the value of MBA degrees had been fueled mainly by   _  . \n Options: (A) the complaints from various employers (B) the success of many non-MBAs (C) the criticism from the scientists of purer disciplines (D) the poor performance of MBAs at work \n Asnwer: A",

            "input": "Article: Through a series of experiments an American scientist has gained an understanding of the social structure of the most complex of ant societies. The ants examined are the only creatures other than man to have given up hunting and collecting for a completely agricultural way of life. In their underground nests they cultivate gardens on soil made from finely chopped leaves. This is a complex operation requiring considerable division of labour. The workers of this type of ants can be divided into four groups according to the size. Each of the groups performs a particular set of jobs.               The making and care of the gardens and the nursing of the young ants are done by the smallest workers. Slightly larger workers are responsible for chopping up leaves to make them suitable for use in the gardens and for cleaning the nest. A third group of still larger ants do the construction work and collect fresh leaves from outside the nest. The largest are the soldier ants, responsible for defending the nest.               To find out how good the various size-groups are at different tasks, the scientist measured the amount of work done by the ants against the amount of energy they used. He examined first the gathering and carrying of leaves. He selected one of the size-groups, and then measured how efficiently these ants could find leaves and run back to the nest. Then he repeated the experiment for each of the other size-groups. In this way he could see whether any group could do the job more efficiently than the group normally undertaking it.               The intermediate-sized ants that normally perform this task proved to be the most efficient for their energy costs, but when the scientist examined the whole set of jobs performed by each group of ants it appeared that some sizes of worker ant were not ideally suited to the particular jobs they performed. \n Question: In which way are the ants different from other non-human societies? \n Options: (A) They do not need to search for food. (B) They do not need to look for shelter. (C) Individuals vary in social status. (D) Individuals perform different functions. \n Asnwer: D",

They're announcing a multi-million dollar international prize to encourage development and research into new forms of low carbon technology. The prize will be available to anyone who can apply a successful method of removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.      Almost all scientists agree that we are experiencing global warming due to increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is released when fuel is burned. Oil, coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas. When biological wasted breaks down, it also releases carbon dioxide.      Environmental campaigners and climate change scientists tell us we're pumping an unbearable amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. One way to reduce that will be to use less fossil fuel , the burning of which is a key resource to our way of life, but sharp reduction of oil and coal use is unpopular with governments and people alike. So technologies are being developed, like carbon capture and storage that aim to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, compress  it and pump it into the ground. But that's still in its early stages, so the purpose of this prize is to encourage research into new ways of decarbonizing the atmosphere. A scientific panel, chaired by Al Gore, will judge any entries. Environmental campaigners are hoping such a significant prize will attract large amounts of publicity and brainpower. \n Question: Which of the following sentences is correct according to the text? \n Options: (A) Al Gore doesn't agree with President Bush's Policy on climate.

Ted Hume The early experiences of Rosa Parks(1913-2005), long known as the \"mother of the civil rights movement, \"were not different from those of many African-Americans at that time. The black woman, however, turned the course of American history in December 1955 when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. \"By sitting down, \"remarked John Lewis, \"she was standing up for all Americans. \" Among the numerous awards Parks received in her life were the Presidential Medal of Freedom(1996)and the Congressional Gold Medal(1999). Parks died on Oct. 24, 2005. At St. Paul A. M. E. Church in Montgomery, a large crowd including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice celebrated her life. Rice said she and others, who grew up when the political activities of Parks held public attention, might not have realized her impact on their lives, \"but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here as Secretary of State. \" After her casket was placed at the Capitol, U. S. President Bush, members of Congress and ordinary Americans paid their respects. In American history Parks is the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol, a very high regard usually reserved for Presidents of the United States. \n Question: What is the main purpose of Susan's email? \n Options: (A) To make arrangements for Professor Hume's class.

It pulls both the front brake and the back brake at the same time. Lauren Turner was able to ride her bike, but not as confidently and quickly as her friends. \"She couldn't use the front brake. She was only using the back brake, but the front brake makes you stop twice as fast,\" says Micha Wallace, who with Katie Bell, Anina Sakaguchi and Andrew Morris won second prize in the James Dyson Awards for their single-handed bike braking lever. \"She used it all last summer and she had no problems. She said it helped her go faster because she felt more confident in her braking abilities. She felt safer.\" says Wallace. The invention was the fourth-year design project for the four students. They designed, tested and created a prototype  within a four-month period. When Wallace heard about the James Dyson Awards on the news, she and her co-inventors entered their project in the UK-based contest. The contest mainly rewards student designers who create products that improve the way we live. The Guelph students collected the second prize -PS2,000 for them, plus PS500 for their school. As well, they had a chance to meet James Dyson, a UK inventor. While praising the students for their creativity, Dyson said the single-handed lever could improve safety for all cyclists. \"By using both brakes at once,\" he explains, \"you could prevent the possibility of flying over the handlebars and ending up with an injury.\" The students are hoping to sell the patent to a major company. It may be used in other devices that require two hands for operation. \n Question: The bike brake lever was designed for the purpose of_. \n Options: (A) winning James Dyson Awards (B) helping people become confident (C) applying for a patent for the invention (D) helping the disabled ride their bike safely \n Asnwer: D",
