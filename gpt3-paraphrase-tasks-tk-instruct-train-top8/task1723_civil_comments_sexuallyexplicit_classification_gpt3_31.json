Here is what I have heard folks  call this so called \"transit\"---all heard at the transit center in Eugene: bum trains,  shame train, limo for lushes, a place to hit up (shoot heroin), trash stash (alluding to the allure of the riders), the mission migrator (all the bums headed to the Eugene Mission between 5:30 and 6:00 when they have curfew), the loony bin; getaway car; and so on.   The U of O students get free passes and the bums get free bus passes.  I have to tell you, I am not paying $65 a month to ride with junkies and bums, petty little criminals, a drunk puking into the seat next to him or the guy passed out in the back, with five garbage bags at his feet blocking the aisles.

The investigation is being headed by the Deschutes County Sheriff's office, with assistance from the Bend and Redmond police departments.\n\nYet, you attempt to make some sort of anti-government conspiracy out of this investigation, when it is being handled normally according to established protocols.   You need to spend more time reading real news, and stop listening to all of the nonsense on these anti-government websites.\n\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/02/investigation_into_death_of_or.html",
