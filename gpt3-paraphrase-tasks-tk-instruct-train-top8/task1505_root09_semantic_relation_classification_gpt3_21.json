    "Definition": [
        "Given a pair of words, your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them. The three possible types of relations are 'HYPER', 'COORD', and 'RANDOM'. The first word in the pair will be denoted by X and the second word will be denoted by Y. A 'COORD' relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A 'HYPER' relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If neither 'COORD' nor 'HYPER' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
