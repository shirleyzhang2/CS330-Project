            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

Here's the thing -- I wanted to learn the story of Isolde and that is why I picked up this book in the first place.  I have read one other Miles book (I, Elizabeth) and that wasn't very impressive but I thought I'd give Isolde a try.  It was painful!  Miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly.  Her characters are very poorly developed.  Also, the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking, 'Wait!  Where the heck did that come from?'  After reading this book, I couldn't decide if I was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak, unskilled writing.",

            "input": "Racist Classist Megalomaniac Talks A Little About Heroin . After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be.  Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others.  I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination).  What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world.  Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull.  I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent.  But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did).  She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her \"coolness\" factor.  Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either.  If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy.  If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick",

It contains hundreds of poems.        I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers.  He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist.  He truly believed in equality and democracy.  He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment.        Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish.  Whitman was a man ahead of his time.",
