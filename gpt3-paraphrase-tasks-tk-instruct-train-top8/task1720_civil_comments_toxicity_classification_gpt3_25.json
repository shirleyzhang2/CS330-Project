Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",

            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

The feel good rhetoric on the city's website is not enough; its not working.  \n\nThe final draft of Vision Zero needs to be something tangible, not rhetoric.  Otherwise, it seems people will continue to let themselves \"be killed at alarming rates\", such as walking into travel lanes.  Since it is the pedestrians and bikers who are the ones being \"killed\", why continue resisting pro-active safety measures that bikers and pedestrians can use to help themselves stay alive? \n\nTo make a real difference, I would think in terms of a since and frank resolution that applies exclusively to the vulnerable.  There are all kinds of forums that apply specifically to consumers, as a self-help tool preventing them from being ripped-off.  It works for consumers, why not for pedestrians and bikers?",
