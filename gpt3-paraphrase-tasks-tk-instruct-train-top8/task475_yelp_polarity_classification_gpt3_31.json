            "input": "The  hubs and I decided to take a 4 night vaca in Vegas and thought we would step it up and stay at the Golden Nugget (we normally stay at the 4 Queens).  \\n\\nRoom - First, let me start out by saying that when we arrived to check in at (4pm)  they didn't have the room type we wanted and said that we would need to change rooms the next day.  They put us in a crappy 3rd floor room with a view of the roof and of the parking garage across the street.  There was some sort of vent on the roof that would whir at intervals that we could hear clearly in the room.  The next day we were moved to the 18th floor to a room that was in the furthest-most-far-away corner from the elevators.  It had a nicer view and a big flatscreen tv (the other room had an older smaller one) and no whirring noise.  However the trade off is that they were doing construction a few floors above us and would start scraping and pounding hammers at 8am.  We got to enjoy that for 2 nights.\\n\\nFood - We ate at the cafe.  It was totally average.  I had to send my salad back because it was nasty (think of a bagged salad that has started showing signs that it needs to be thrown out).  They did replace it with much better lettuce but it was still just blah.   The breakfast/lunch buffet (we arrive there right as they were switching for lunch) was good.  It was a decent variety of food and some good desserts.\\n\\nI can't really rate the casino because we were really not impressed by the GN so we weren't inclined to spend our money there.\\n\\nOverall, I probably won't be staying there again!\\n\\nOne last thing - what is up with the poor quality tp at all downtown hotels?  I thought that the GN would at least have some decent tp!",

I am not a fan of pancakes, so I had a regular breakfast. It was not amazing---nothing that I couldn't match at home. \\n\\nI personally would not come back here.",

There is normally a game of some type on the television. If you eat in the dinning area, the food is hot or cold as requested and if something isn't right they correct the issue and normally comp something.  Personally I am a huge fan of the chicken salad wrap, and the Chinese grill chicken wrap, my dad likes the roast beef dip.  The cinnamon bun is AMAZING. If you are in the university area and want a sandwich. This is the best place in the area.",

I had the veal parm which was great. \\nIf you are in town for a meeting, give it a try",
