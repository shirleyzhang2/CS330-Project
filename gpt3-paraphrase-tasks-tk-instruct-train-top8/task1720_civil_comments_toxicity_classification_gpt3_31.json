Incidentally, his complaint and associated arguments were rejected by the Tax Court, by the U.S. District Court, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In other words, literally nobody agreed with him, and he found out the hard way that living in Texas makes him a citizen of Texas and the United States, which obligates him to pay his damn taxes like the rest of us. Just because someone crams a bunch of words, statutes, and case law citations together in a document sprinkled with lawyerly language does not make it a legitimate or lawful argument.",
            "output": "Yes",
            "explanation": "The comment does not have any explicit curses or derogatory words in it. The word 'damn' has a negative tone but is not used as an attack on anything. Therefore, this is a negative example."

            "explanation": "The comment doesn't have any curse words in it, however it is toxic because based on subject's name 'Hasselberger' a toxic judgement has been made implying that dealing with her is a hassle. Therefore, this is a negative example."

Stop spending money, and don't raise taxes on oil companies they will invest somewhere else. If you don't the change in oil prices will be more painful than necessary. when you have a market based mostly on oil every time it goes up you raise your  budget then when it goes down you need to reduce your budget. It's like the guy who's house goes up in value but instead of being happy they have equity they borrow the new amount then when it goes down they cry about still owing more than they can sell for. Whe the economy does good you save some because the markets will always have ups and downs. also now OPEC has competition these low oil prices  may be some what permanent. Raising oil tax equals less oil production. The state legislature is being sued, and evicted out of it's building in anchorage thats the level of competence you are dealing w.",
