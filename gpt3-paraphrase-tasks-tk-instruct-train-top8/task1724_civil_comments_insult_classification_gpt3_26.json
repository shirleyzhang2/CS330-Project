They have rightfully accepted the science that has proven induced demand (building more travel lanes induces more extra driving than those lanes can handle, thus increasing congestion; one trip to SoCal shows what this means).\n\nHere, our backwards traffic planners/engineers continue to be beholden to a failed model. These bozos even shut down the Fern Ridge bike path for half a year (again!) for work that should have taken less than two weeks.\n\nEugene needs to fire its city manager and all of his managers for at least four tiers down.

Real classy those conservatives are. \n\nIf the conservative thinks government employment is so lucrative, he or she had ample opportunity to obtain one of those \"high paying, awesome benefits\" jobs. The fact they never did is their problem. Instead the rag-a-colic conservative does the bidding of the 1%ers by attacking other middle class Americans and thus demonstrating they are too ignorant to know who they should be mad at.
