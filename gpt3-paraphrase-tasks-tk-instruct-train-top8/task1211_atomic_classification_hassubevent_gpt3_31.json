    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. Head and Tail are events that are short and may involve participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words. PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether the Head includes an event or action from the Tail. This happens when the Tail is a smaller part of the Head event. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", which is a placeholder for an object, person, and/or action."
