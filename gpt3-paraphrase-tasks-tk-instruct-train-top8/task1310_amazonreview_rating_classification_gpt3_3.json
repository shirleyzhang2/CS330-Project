I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

There was no option to select the pants size, so I received a 30 waist x 32 inseam pants for a 38 R jacket. The jacket barely fits, but that is to be expected since it's a slim fit/ cut, but the pants are way too small, so essentially it's a $99 jacket and useless pants or return everything and shop elsewhere. You can figure out which option I chose, but I clearly won't be shopping on Amazon or this vendor again for a suit, no matter how good the price is. It just seems that you can't beat shopping at a retail store for clothing, shoes, among many other things.",
