An election victory would also provide Abe with what may be his best, and possibly last, chance to secure the majority needed to begin the process of revising Japan's pacifist constitution. Abe, a deeply divisive and unpopular figure within many parts of Japan, has so far struggled to engage voters beyond his core support. In the weeks preceding the election, approval ratings for Abe's Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) have stood at a mere 37%, a low bar even by Japanese standards, where enthusiasm for political parties remains apathetic at best.Voter turnout could drop below 50% for first time in postwar historyLack of credible opposition and voter apathy expected to result in Abe victory \n Questions:\"But the collapse, or the failure of the system to provide any alternative (opposition voice) is very dangerous for _ democracy.\" (A) CNN (B) Japan (C) Shinzo Abe (D) Abe (E) Liberal Democrat Party (F) LDP",

He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in an exclusive television interview that he stuck to his assigned duties and tried to take photos after he was done escorting President Obama. Members of Congress were upset when the media reported last month that Tate had a .40-caliber handgun while in an elevator with the President. That report, coupled with news of an incident in which a man jumped a fence and made it into the White House, led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson.Fired security guard tells CNN he stuck to his assigned dutiesKenneth Tate only went to take pictures when the detail was over, he saysFederal official says CDC asked for Tate to be reassignedTate says he carried a handgun that he was given, never took photos of President on elevator \n Questions:Tate said he was supposed to take the President to two different floors of one of the _ buildings.
