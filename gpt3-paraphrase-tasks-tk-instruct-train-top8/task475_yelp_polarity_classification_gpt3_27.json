            "input": "I would give ZERO if I could. I opened a month to month account while I was visiting my parents over the Summer. I joined March 28, 2014. I went a few times and then something came up where I needed to leave back home with very minimal notice. I called and spoke with a representative who advised me I needed to come in person to cancel. I advised of my situation, that I needed to leave back to Northern California where I live and would not be able to get there to cancel. The representative told me he would let a manager know, and they would be able to get it taken care of for me due to the circumstances. I called in the next day once I was back in California as I did not receive a call back, I was again advised the manager was busy, but that it would be taken care of and someone would call me back. This was around June 26, 2014. I then kept being billed in July, August, and then again in September for the monthly fee of $20, I also was charged the $39 one time fee, which should not have been charged as I cancelled prior to the 30 days. Between June 26 and and August 30th I had attempted to reach someone with this company through phone and email with the same old response, a manager would call me back, and NO ONE EVER TO THIS DAY has called me back. I also tried calling the Corporate number, that is a joke, I get to leave a voice-mail and someone from corporate will call me back. Again never have I received a call back. I even emailed them through their contact request page on www.thesmartgyms.com multiple times again to NEVER get a response back. On August 30th I finally felt like I had no other options and opened a dispute with my bank. I was being billed for a service I had requested to be cancelled in June and it was going to be billed to me again in September even though I had attempted to contact this company a ridiculous amount of times an not one word back from them ever. My bank did it's investigation and credited me back for July, August, September and the $39 one time fee. I did not dispute my June payment as I was there and used it for those couple weeks. Still nothing from this company until last week on November 14th I get a call from their Collection Agency saying I owe them almost $400!!! I explained the whole thing to Troy with their collections, and I got the typical rude collection agent response. Too bad so sad, pay it or screw up your credit royally. Well I am a full time college student, and I don't have almost $400 just laying around to pay for services I have been trying to cancel for months! What else was I to do as a consumer who could NOT REACH ANYONE from this company?! I do not live there, I cannot go and wait for someone. After my call with the collection guy, I immediately called the gym again, this time I spoke with an Assistant Manager who I explained everything to and she advised me they would get it taken care of that day. Remove me from collections and straighten out the account, BUT a manager had to do this. She ensured me she would pass the information along and the Manager Jonnie N. would be responding, she even gave me his email. Again I waited and waited to never get a call back, I called in again and asked for Jonnie directly, he was busy, would call me back. The same old same old I had been hearing since June. I emailed Jonnie, to never get a response either, I called again and again and nothing and today the Collection Guy called again. What did he say when I advised that the manager was going to be taking care of this for me, he laughed and said no that wont happen. He can't do anything only corporate, and they won't change it either. So I called the gym again and was told the same thing that a Jonnie was busy and would call me back. Might I add I am calm for the most part, I might get cry emotional, but not angry so I don't see why I am so blatantly being ignored. I feel like I cannot get anywhere with this company. This company has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH! I worked in the customer service industry for years, and this is absolutely horrible what they are doing. I can see from some other reviews I am not the first person this has happened to, and those people live in state and went in to this business and still got nowhere. DO NOT GO HERE! Just based on principle alone this company should not be allowed to be in business if they are treating the customers this way. Not everyone is going to stay on with a gym, it doesn't mean they should continue to screw with those people and ruin their credit just because they had to or chose to cancel! It is sickening. After all that has been going on I had to write this review, as well as a formal complaint to the Better Business Bureau, the way this company has handled this entire situation is absolutely ridiculous.",

They recently opened in September 2013 and the salon is family owned.  I called the day of, and made an appointment.  Upon arriving, I was greeted by the owner, and picked out the polish.  As I was doing so, the male owner assisted and showed me all the options.  They have many colors to choose from.  I didn't catch the name of the lady that did my nails, but she was very gentle, thorough, and all the while, the husband and wife owner checked in to see how things were going.  They offered bottled water, and engaged in conversation.  All tools are sterilized and individually wrapped, all the equipment is brand new.  The gel manicure is regularly $35 and during grand opening it is 30% off.  So far, a week later, the gel manicure is still going strong.  No chips or flakes.  I will be back!!",

As a member of the Le Grande L'Orange chain of the best eateries in town, Radio Milano has stepped it up to live up to expectations of those who live for Chelsea's, Postinos and LGO. The scallops were to die for and I highly suggest trying out the chocolate pudding for dessert. It tastes more like a chocolate malt. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is great and it's perfect for either a date or a night out with friends or family. \\n\\nRemember -- go on Monday or Tuesday when it's neighborhood night. For $20, you get a salad or dessert and any entree on the menu. You can't beat it! Every Phoenix restaurant should follow the Neighborhood Night trend.",
