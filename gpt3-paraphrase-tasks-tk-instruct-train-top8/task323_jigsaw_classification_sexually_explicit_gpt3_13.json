Hillary is bi-sexual and has a lover who is a Muslim and married to Anthony Weiner (enuf said).  It appears that Trump was having consensual sex with Ms. Universe contestants while Billy Boy was dragging one hundred dollar bills through trailer courts in Arkansas when he was not raping women.  On top of that Hillary has said in both debates that when they go low we go high.  Hillary is the one throwing all the dirt just how low can she go while saying she is going high.  When demonrats have sex they make their guys rock stars.  However when republicans have consensual sex with Miss Universe contestants that is some how naughty.  Additionally Trump has not left any of his lovers in his car at the bottom of a river ala Ted Kennedy.",
