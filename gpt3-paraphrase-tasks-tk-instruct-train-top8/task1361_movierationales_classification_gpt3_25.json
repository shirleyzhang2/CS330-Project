this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg 's star - making role in boogie nights .\nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone .\ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me .\nhe 's all wrong for a lead role , but it does n't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters .\nby the end of 54 , shane 's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent .\nthe rest of the performances are wasted .\nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here .\nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard .\nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher 's wading - pool of a script .\nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .\nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him .\ni 've read that studio 54\nhas been recreated down to the last detail .\nfrankly , i do n't care .\nit 's easy to recreate something technical like this .\na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task .\nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . aside from myers ' performance , 54 is a complete failure .\nit 's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .\nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they 're so obvious to me .\nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast .\nit does n't even work as mindless entertainment : it 's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it .\nso , do n't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .\neverything else i said was just padding .",

            "input": "\" footloose \" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel - good antics .\nand i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .\nthe movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .\nhe ends up falling for the preacher 's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .\nas mentioned at the beginning of this review , \" footloose \" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .\nthere are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second - rate .\nso\nwhy did i enjoy it so much ? for one thing ,\nthe cast is great .\nkevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .\nwe 're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon does n't play him as the \" rebel without a clue \" sort .\nyes , he does rebel , but he 's also polite when he needs to be .\nand he never broods .\nthe rest of the cast is equally impressive .\njohn lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .\nbut lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .\nby the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .\nanother nice touch is the music .\nwe see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with \" sexual innuendos \" , but that 's not true at all .\nthe title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .\nduring the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing\n.\nof course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .\nanyway , \" footloose \" is a charming little surprise .\ndo n't let the premise prevent you from watching it .\nit sucked me in , and it 'll do the same to you .",

            "input": "i think maybe it 's time for the batman series to be put to rest .\nnot only has the first two films ' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a \" superhero \" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all - out camp with few traces of the self - mocking restraint of the relatively light - hearted third installment .\nlet me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr .\nfreeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .\nmr .\nfreeze 's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick - handles it through the museum .\ni might have expected this from an airplane - style farce , but i do n't think that 's what this movie is supposed to be . after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero / action genre and kept the corny death - defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .\nnot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .\nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman .\nmr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .\na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he - man cartoons .\nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her .\nnot bad , but would n't the police ( or maybe batman ? )\nnotice if the road was on fire ?\ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place ,\nbut . . . . it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment .\nas if three protagonists and two villains were n't enough , batman and robin\nfurther weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne 's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it was n't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce 's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie .\nall this might be semi - excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it is n't . in fact ,\nit 's kind of boring\n.\nmr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson 's joker and danny devito 's penguin .\ntheir evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , \" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! \" ) as it is lame - brained\n( did n't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) .\nand robin 's constant challenging of batman\nmostly just makes him look bull - headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place .\nstrip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a \" batman movie , \" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .",
