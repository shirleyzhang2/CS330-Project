            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

And this year was no different, a tadpole, Louis names Alphonse.  But it soon becomes apparent that Alphonse is not your normal, everyday tadpole and definitely not turning into a frog.  He soon outgrows his jar, then the kitchen sink, and bathtub.  Louis sneaks him into the school swimming pool during summer vacation, and that works out just fine until fall when school opens.  In a panic Louis consults Miss Seevers, the librarian.  Librarians always have all the answers, and Miss Seevers doesn't let him down.  With a phone call to Scotland, a little research, and a lot of ingenuity, Louis and Miss Severs find a clever solution and happily-ever-after ending to their problem.....  First published twenty-five years ago, Steven Kellogg's creative classic, The Mysterious Tadpole, is as fresh and entertaining today as it was back in 1977.  Mr Kellogg has given his new illustrations a bold and bright facelift, and tweaked the text a bit, but the engaging and fun-filled story with its hilarious twist at the end, is still sure to capture the imagination and warm your heart.  Perfect for youngsters 3-7, The Mysterious Tadpole is a timeless treasure to share with friends and family now, and future generations in the years to come",

            "input": "Good only for 007 fans. . You will find the Ornithologist James Bond's old employer, Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences does not sell copies of this book.  They will sell you Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book instead.    Why?    Because, it is at least from the 1930.  it contains information which is seriously dated.  Not to mention that the pictures are mostly in black and white with only about 10 colour plates.  The pictures that are contained in the volume are not very representative of the birds you will encounter.    This book is acceptable if you intend on bird watching on your caribbean holiday, but we spent much of our time guessing if we were really looking at a bird.  Yes, you can take a book of Eastern US birds with you, but do you want to take a birdwatching library with you on your holiday?  Not to mention there are birds which will not show up in a US Bird book (e.g., bananaquit and parrots).    You will notice that the most effusive reviews of this book come from fans of Ian Fleming's 007, not bird watchers.  That is because this book is much more a piece of 007 trivia than useful to modern bird watchers.    The story of How Ian Fleming's agent was named was that Fleming was at Goldeneye, his Jamaican house, and needed a name for the protagonist of his spy novel.  Fleming wanted a plain name and his eye came upon his copy of James Bond's \"Birds of the West Indies\", which Fleming described as his bible.  Fleming thought that James Bond would be the perfect name for his spy (No, Audobon would not have been a possibility).  Mr. Fleming paid the ornithologist a dollar a year for the privilege of using  the name James Bond in his novels.    Serious bird watchers are better served buying Herbert Raffaele's updated version of this book or James Kavanagh's \"Caribbean Birds\".    You could also be sentimental and want this because it was what you used when you were young during the period that this version of \"Birds of the West Indies\" was the only show in town.    In case you haven't guessed, I am both a bird watcher and James Bond fan who owns two copies of this book.  Consider this review with that in mind",

I followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route, but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed. In India he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society, the strange vestments and customs of the people there, so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced. Then he spends years and years in the Orient, befriending the Chinese emperor, learns to speak Chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native Italian, even becomes governor of a Chinese state. From adolescence intoto adulthood, Marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years, discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west, by ship, elephant or camel, or on foot over some of the world's highest mountains, against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism.",

But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.     The reason for this one star rating is this.   First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!   Second, 496 pages filled with \"blah blah blah\" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.     Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.    Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.    Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton.",

            "input": "Ivory tower crackpot theories. . No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his \"experimental school.\" Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of \"progressivism?\" I would.    Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?    Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their \"natural inquisitiveness\" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the \"plus-que-parfait\" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.    90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's \"progressivism\" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one",
