        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated by <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonX wants what is mentioned in the Tail. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonX, respectively. As an example, if as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonX desires to hug PersonY, then the answer would be classified as \"Yes\". If there is no desire for PersonX to do the Tail event, then the answer would be classified as \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
