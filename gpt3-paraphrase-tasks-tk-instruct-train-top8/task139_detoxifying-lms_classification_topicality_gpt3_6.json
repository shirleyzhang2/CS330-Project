    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is more relevant to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is considered to be topical if the completion maintains relevance and logical succession (i.e. stays on topic) with the prompt. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
