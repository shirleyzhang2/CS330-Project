Development in these Central American countries following the overthrow of the Spanish led to the creation of the Banana Republic. All development projects were based around the export economy. These countries did not spend money on domestic infrastructure or education, the two most important expenditures of a modern economy. When the natives you speak of organized to overthrow the US-backed dictators, they were crushed with the full support of the US. One needn't look as far back as Ronnie Reagan and his support of the Contra death squads in Nicaragua or his support of the genocidal dictator Rios Montt in Guatemala to see the affects.\n\nIt seems you support the overthrow of the democratically-elected leaders in Central America in support of foreign commercial interests. The poor indigenous populations that battled against them are no different than American colonists at the birth of this country.",
