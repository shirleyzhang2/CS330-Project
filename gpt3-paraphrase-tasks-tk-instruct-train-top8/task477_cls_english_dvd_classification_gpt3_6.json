As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

The bottom line is:  every JAM fan should own this immediately - the quality/range of the material included on this amazing 2-DVD set is AWESOME...BUT as much as love all the TV clips, archival footage (esp the cool &quot;Meet the Jam&quot; piece!), live segments, and videos, I do wish they would have included the VIDEO version of the Jam's final single, &quot;BEAT SURRENDER&quot; which I sometimes would see on early MTV - it's really polished and exciting, oh well...AND also, where is the stunning, raw set they did on ABC's early 80's late-night &quot;FRIDAYS&quot; show, etc.  These omissions are the only reason why I docked it one star - since it's really not &quot;complete&quot; but for any JAM fans, even casual ones, this is a definite MUST-HAVE keeper DVD you will go back to again and again!!  Makes you feel nostalgic and even a bit SAD for a time lost in pop/rock music, never to be returned!",

            "input": "The second worst dinosaur movie . First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.    The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.    It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.    If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)    If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.    If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'    But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park",

I have no idea what these people are talking about.  Yes, some episodes were better than others and some plotlines were tedious, but I still thought this was a great season.  The main theme of this season is the planning of Monica and Chandler's wedding, but there are many storylines scattered throughout, such as Rachel's romance with her assistant, Joey returning to Days of Our Lives, the brief return of Phoebe's scientist boyfriend, and Ross learning to play bagpipes.  This season will have you in stitches!    Here's a list of my favorite episodes from this season:    The One With Phoebe's Cookies  The One With Rachel's Assistant  The One With the Nap Partners  The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs  The One With All the Candy  The One With the Holiday Armadillo  The One Where Rosita Dies  The One Where They All Turn Thirty  The One With Joey's New Brain  The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress  The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin  The One With the Vows  The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding    Next is the season where Rachel is pregnant!

            "input": "A LESSON TO REMEMBER... . This is the story of two girls, Alice Marano (Claire Danes) and Darlene Davis (Kate Beckinsale), who are best friends. Alice is from a blue collar background, while Darlene's family is white collar. They have just graduated from high school and are supposed to be going on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate, except that Alice convinces Darlene that they should, instead, go a more exotic locattion. So, while telling their parents they are off to Hawaii, they end up going to Thailand, where they flop in a six dollar a night fleabag hotel, replete with roaches the size of potatoes.     They hook up with a handsome, young Australian named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine), who engages their confidence and with whom they briefly end up hanging out. Alice and Darlene find themselves competing for his interest. He then invites them to accompany him for a weekend in Hong Kong and, ultimately, both agree. While at the airport to board their flight to Hong Kong, they suddenly discover themselves under arrest, as one of their backpacks is found to contain a large cache of drugs, much to their collective surprise.    The girls then begin a journey through the Tibetan criminal justice system, which appears to be a corrupt one and especially harsh on the drug trafficking of which they are accused. Alice, the more savvy one, declines to sign anything, while Darlene, the more naive of the two, signs a statement written in Thai that she believes to be a transcript of her own words, only later to find that she has signed a complete confession. Even after obtaining legal representation from an expatriate attorney named Yankee Hank Green (Bill Pullman), they still end up being sentenced to a very long prison term. This is where the movie really starts focusing on what it is really all about, their friendship.     Excellent performances are given by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale, as well as Bill Pullman. While Claire Danes give her somewhat hard edged character a certain vulnerability, somehow the viewer knows that she could probably do the time to which she is sentenced while standing on her head. Kate Beckinsale imbues her her character with a fragility that lets the viewer know that if she stays in that Tibeetan prison for very long, she will be a goner.    While the ending comes as somewhat of a surprise, it is somehow fitting. Yet, at the same time it is puzzling, as it is almost as if there were an atonement involved, but the viewer is left guessing as for what. The film is a compelling one, but in the final analysis falls somewhat short of its mark, with questions unanswered and motives left open to speculation. Still, the film manages to entertain, notwithstanding these shortcomings",

            "input": "If you think you've seen it before... . ...you have. This film has been compared to \"Logan's Run\", \"The Matrix\", and \"Coma\", to name a few, but it most strongly resembles 1979 B movie \"Parts: The Clonus Horror\", probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". Sitting through \"The Island\", I kept thinking to myself \"Boy, this looks familiar.\" In fact, \"The Island\" is almost a complete, play-by-play clone (ba da ching!) of \"Parts\", right down to the outfits worn by the clones. There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of \"Parts\", which should be an open-and-shut case.   This film is set in a futuristic clone colonie, where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts. The clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility's employees, not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise (the Island). Of course, the clones allegedly going to the Island are actually being euthanized for their organs, their patrons having gotten sick. The movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise. Ewan McGregor is satisfactory in this role, his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge. His female counterpart, Scarlet Johansen, is pure eye candy, a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead (or even a major part) in a college play (the best performance is turned in by Sean Bean, the Evil Scientist\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd.)There is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on, making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie, but it is not only nothing special, it is nothing original. Maybe worth a rental, but not much more",
