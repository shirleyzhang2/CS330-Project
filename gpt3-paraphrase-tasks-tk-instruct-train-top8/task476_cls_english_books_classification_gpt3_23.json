            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

            "input": "Disappointing . The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, \"barriers to entry\" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain \"Competition Demystified\"    With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book \"A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy \". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say \"The end of competition\". Kindly recall \"The end of history...\"    The book however deserves praise for use of  Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy.     Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms.    Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish.",

            "input": "disappointed . This book was entertaining, but... there is only one 19-page chapter dedicated to the problem of \"inappropriate elimination\" (peeing/pooping in the wrong place), even though the author himself describes it as \"the number one behavior problem\".  He says \"No other problem causes so much grief and leads them so often to consider the final solution of euthanasia\".  I want to ask the author: given that, don't you think most people are buying the book for that reason and you should have dedicated more time to this topic???  The stories in that chapter did not contain any revelations for me - his examples all had fairly obvious causes and were easy to fix, such as the owner changed the litter box, boyfriend moved in, owner had 2 litter boxes for 6 cats, or the cat is doing it out of anxiety and responds nicely to medication (lucky them).  Throughout the book, I wish he had spent less time making cute anecdotes and more time detailing possible effective interventions",

I can't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book, there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that, but other than that I'll have to read the other reviews. Anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which God goes to in order to bring us to Salvation, while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it's beauty and glory in careful suspension. I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger. Still I'll bet that when we get to heaven God will truthfully say, it hurt me far, far more than it hurt you. Amen.",

I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the \"extremely difficult themes\" and \"brilliant artistry\" of the play",
