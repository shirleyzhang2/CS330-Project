    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given a short story with a beginning, two potential middles, and an ending. Your task is to output \"1\" or \"2\" depending on which middle statement makes the story more coherent or plausible. If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes most sense."

            "input": "Beginning: Butch had a really old computer. Middle 1: Butch decided to order a new computer online. Middle 2: Butch noticed that a storm was approaching to his town. Ending: It arrived and Butch was much happier.",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "People generally don't feel happy about natural disasters like storms. Therefore, we choose 1 in this case."

            "input": "Beginning: John was on the trail running. Middle 1: John accelerated the speed and broke his leg accidentally. Middle 2: John was chased by a bear. Ending: He ran even faster until he got to his car safely.",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "When someone breaks his/her leg, it is difficult to run. Therefore, we choose 2 in this case."

            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "In this example, both Middle sentences sound plausible, but the first one is MORE plausible as a story. Therefore, we choose 1 in this case."

            "input": "Beginning: Mary's mom came home with more bananas than they could possibly eat. Middle 1: Mary and her mom decided to make chocolate covered frozen bananas to avoid waste. Middle 2: So Mary made pineapple splits for everyone. Ending: That was the best way ever to eat a banana!",
            "output": "2",
            "explanation": "The story talks about bananas, so discussion of pineapples makes the story incoherent. Therefore, we should not choose 2 in this case."
