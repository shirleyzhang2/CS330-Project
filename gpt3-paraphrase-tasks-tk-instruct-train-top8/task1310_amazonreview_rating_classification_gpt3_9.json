I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

It's ... average. It's okay. It's nothing especially special.",

Then the tank on the recoil spring broke which meant I had to take the whole spring out rebend it then coil it back up. Then the cord had to snap again because of rubbing on the metal. Then after that when I took the pull started off I saw that one the posts which holds the springs and ratchet pawls had snapped off. Such a pain. Not even worth the 2 dollars they pay to make it in china. Your better off starting your motor with a drill.",
