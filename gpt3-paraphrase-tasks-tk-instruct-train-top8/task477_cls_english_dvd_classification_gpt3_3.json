As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

            "input": "Mediocre At Best . If you're expecting the same power and intensity of \"Scooby Doo On Zombie Island\" or \"Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost,\" then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment. It is possible that certain powers felt that the first 2 Scooby movies were too much for children, but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact, suspense, character development, and even mystery. It may be true that even a medocre Scooby movie is better than no Scooby movie at all, but this movie is almost boring after \"Zombie Island\" or \"Witch's Ghost.\" Well, Scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert. Fred, Daphne, and Velmah go on foot for help while Scooby and Shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion. With their famous and hilarious cowardly ways, they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. At the restaurant, the gang is surprised that the other patrons don't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens. We also meet Lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area. Lester lets the gang stay the night, and Scooby and Shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens.' Moving on, Scooby and Shaggy meet Amber and Crystal, and are attracted to them. They later meet the mechanic Buck as well as a team of scientists (that we already have met). Unlike \"Zombie Island\" and \"Witch's Ghost,\" the misleads are not really well drawn. Also, rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains, we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious. Even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story (in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything) it's nothing most people couldn't have figured out. I won't deny that there are some good moments in this movie. (For undoubtedly the first time, Scooby and Shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing!)  But even the old episodes were usually better than this movie. Parents may not have to screen this movie, but it is  likely that even children will fall asleep during this one. Thank goodness for the eventual \"Legend of the Vampire\" and \"Aloha Scooby Doo.\"",

            "input": "But we can be any self we want, can't we? . The Governess was, by far, a very pitiful film.  I do not use this word loosely, as it honestly was a poor excuse for a movie.  I finished watching this feature with only one word on my mind ... \"why\"?  Honestly, you could use this question at the end of every scene of this film and it would seem like it fit.  There were so many inconsistencies that lead to a lack of development (both in the story and in the characters) which ultimately lead to a very confusing film with actors walking through the motions instead of giving any explanation.  Scenes would occur with no foreshadowing, understanding, or drive to a complete ending.  It was as if I was watching several different ideas thrown together without really any resolution.  Actors were setting events in motion that did not seem to fit their character or really were resolved.  This was my biggest issue with this film.  The complete and utter lack of structure to this film brought all specks of foundation crumbling down with a genuine \"ripple-effect\" being felt throughout the rest of the film as a result.     Let me explain myself further on this lack of consistency throughout the film.  I would liken this film to a bowl of lumpy oatmeal that had a zebra in it.  It made no sense nor was there any logic behind it all.  Minnie Driver was the worst culprit of this deed.  Her character's lines were drawn very fuzzy and nearly transparent.  She would do things like talk about sex all the time with her sister, but yet she seemed very open to sexual experiences all the time.  She has her first moment of passion in this film, and there is no pain or excitement.  It nonchalantly happens, and this just didn't seem to fit the original conversation that we had at the beginning of the film with Rosina and her sister.  She is a very intelligent woman that accidentally finds a solution to Wilkinson's problem and suddenly wants full rights to his invention?  That was confusing and completely random.  Is it not obvious to anyone else that her teaching methods were non-existent.  Anyone in their right mind could see that she wasn't teaching Cavendish's daughter anything.  The sudden and awkward relationship that randomly forms between Driver and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers nearly had me laughing out loud.  I thought maybe I had discovered some magic in this film as Rhys-Meyers literally \"poofed\" into the scene and suddenly caused some unneeded drama.  It felt that the director (or writer) was thinking that the original story was going nowhere fast, so by adding this random character we may be able to advance the plot a bit (or confuse the lesser film enthusiasts).  Well, it didn't fool me, I saw that he was nearly a \"cut-and-paste\" character used to strengthen an already weakened story.  Don't get me started on the ending, which had no consistency to the rest of the story.  Again using the \"cut-and-paste\" method, the writer of this film needed a way to just end the story, and this was the only solution they could arrive to.  It is sad when actors are forced to do things out of character ... but I guess that is the name of the game in Hollywood.  Fix until completely broken, or at least salvageable.      The remainder of the story was unexciting dribble.  There were maybe a handful of neat cinematography moments where you could see that there was one sliver of creativity trying to peak through coupled with some bars of decent, period piece music, but nothing to write to Grandma about.  More family structure with some stronger introductions could have strengthened this film a bit more, but as I stated before, by leaving open-ended scenes just lying around the entire film, you will experience a crack in your foundation.  What may seem like a sturdy story, will eventually wear down over time, and by the end of this film I felt that the house was crumbling down on top of me.  Wilkinson plays his normal self in this film, while Driver apparently did not want to get naked, but everyone else had too (I will have to see a doctor after those images were burned into my eyes ... eeewwww).  Also, she wore the same dress everyday.  That was disgusting and I could smell her through the television.  Sex and dirty laundry.  Now there is a great film for you!  There just seemed to be some potential floating around here, but instead it was just rubbish.  Nothing was answered, questions seemed to fall like snow in Alaska, and mediocrity seemed to reign supreme.    Overall, this could have been a decent film that combined the powerful themes of science and love together, but instead it was just pitiful.  I cannot stress enough the disturbing fact that characters were going through motions without any sort of pre-explanation.  I don't need cinematic moments handed to me like a child, but something should have been done to build a foundation.  Just remember the oatmeal with a zebra analogy that I used.  If you were as confused about that as I was, then you will completely understand the film The Governess, while if you prefer zebras in your oatmeal ... then, maybe this film is for you!
