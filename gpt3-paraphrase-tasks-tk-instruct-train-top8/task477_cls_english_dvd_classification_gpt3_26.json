As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.

            "input": "Walk softly, carry a big stick, and have Johnny Knoxville as backup . Ex-Special Forces Chris Vaughn (Da Rock) returns to his hometown of Kitsap County, Washington after 8 years in the soldiering business. He intends to fulfill his dream of working at the town sawmill, but finds that it has gone out of business. In fact, things have changed for the worse in Kitsap County and home isn't home anymore. There's now a nasty element in the former little town and Chris's old friend Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) seems to be in the thick of things, with his thriving casino and burgeoning drug empire. It doesn't take long for Chris to nose out the corruption and soon, Chris and Jay are at vicious odds with each other. After Chris is beaten and tortured and his young nephew falls prey to crystal meth, Chris runs for and becomes the local sheriff. He then tries to set things right with his town, waging his own personal battle against crime, armed only with a length of cedar and the loony but dependable help of his buddy Ray (Johnny Knoxville).       This film is a distant cousin of the first Walking Tall movie back in 1973, which told the more or less true story of Sheriff Buford Pusser. The premise is the same, that of a man who has had enough of vice and crookedness infesting his town and decides to do something about it - to wit, getting elected Sheriff. But this movie version has the Rock, filmdom's newest big action star, and is therefore invested with Rock-like sensibilities. Walking Tall (2004) is more action-oriented, with the action scenes more slick and kinetic. It doesn't take itself as serious as the original;  it is, in fact, laden with a healthy dose of rowdy humor, much of it being contributed by wildman Johnny Knoxville. At a running time of one hour and 27 minutes, director Kevin Bray doesn't try to embroil the viewer into too much set-up, but instead gets right to the nitty-gritty, quickly delivering what the fans crave - the Rock's physicality and charisma.      Yes, the Rock is an action star. He'll never do Shakespeare or go on stage. But, in his specific genre, he shines. And he does have enough thespian in him to capably and convincingly play his formulaic silent but kick-ass roles. What sets him apart from other would-be stars such as Van Damme and Seagal is that the Rock is imbued with a self-deprecating, wink-of-an-eye (arch of an eyebrow?) quality that enables viewers to like him and identify with him. The rest of the cast, with two exceptions, are mediocre and bland, but, at least, they don't hurt the film. The intense Neal McDonough stands out as he invests his villain with frozen, blue-eyed menace and cold-blooded venom. A very good and formidable villain indeed. Johnny Knoxville is just plain fun to watch as he plays his Ray Templeton with unpredictable wackiness. The laugh he uses (I don't know if that's his real laugh) when he and Chris are watching television is just plain out infectious.     Basically, this little actioner, the Rock's follow up to the superior The Rundown, doesn't have anything new to say. It is what it is: a short, enjoyable movie that's sure to give the audience a good time. It certainly beats Son of theMask, or a fork in the eye.  It gets 3 and a half stars from me.",

I like this film because several reasons, unlike most of the National Lampoon's I've recently seen, this was the least silly & disgusting. there was a better plot to it, Paris Hilton is a fine actor! alot of people would say she's playing herself in this movie but if u think that, then u don't really know her. but I'm not getting into that. now to the plot, Veronica(Hilton) is the hottest girl in the school, popular, dating the \"hottest\" guy on campus & is totally rich! looking to win a chance to get a photoshoot for FHM, she needs the hottest girls to compete with her. only that doesn't go so well when she starts treating some of the wannabees like crap & they decide to retaliate. there is a journey of self-discovery, lessons to be learned but it's not a big part of the film & kinda comes from nowhere. lots of this doesn't make sense but who cares. it's a very cheesy flick but it has humor, nudity, all the things u'd want from a National Lampoon's flick & I give it points for trying something new & actually having a point to the film! I say it's a good film to see, though maybe not a family film, it's still worth your time!",

            "input": "Are You Serious? . I watched this movie with my 7 year old daughter, and regretted it about 10 minutes in.  After reading Queen Bees & Wannabees, I can't help but despair whenever I look over the precipice and get a glimpse into teen girl world.      In Barbie's envisioning of this world the central theme is to \"be yourself\", but in the end they only seek themselves in a banal existence of dress shopping, chasing each others' boyfriends, inventing lip gloss disguised as a highlighter, deciding what to wear to an afternoon of watching cute boys practice football, and halfheartedly pursuing a career as a rock star.  While I realize that this is teenage girl reality, is this what needs to be held up to pre-teens as a personality blueprint?    The popular girls look exactly like the unpopular girls, so it's not like the criteria for who gets to set foot on the \"popular lawn\" is really clear, other than you have to be mean-spirited and backstabbing.  But at least they somewhat captured the spirit of what it's like to be on the outside looking in.    Of course, there's the \"magic diary\" aspect of the story, which seemed the only tie to the \"other\" Barbie world (Fairytopia, Mermadia, et all).  I realized then what I was really watching...a marketing cry for help from Mattel.  The target demo for Barbie has shrunk to 3-6 year old girls, and they're trying desperately to expand back into the 7-11 range that other brands like Bratz are chipping away at.  I promptly dumped all Mattel stock from my 401k.",

            "input": "Appalling Excess . I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:    First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say \"That's not in the book...that's not in the book...\"    Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.       I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...     A kid chasing a ticket through a train,     A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,     A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,    (Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)    OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...    A train sliding out of control on the ice,    A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,    A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the \"coaster tycoon\" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole.     Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...    A train car running out of control through Santa's village,    Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...    Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.    At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!      And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.    So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a \"character driven\" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.    I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.",

I don't know if that's true with Johnny but I know it sure doesn't hurt. This is a very young Johnny with Luther and Marshal. Three friends, lots of fans, and a set of songs that you'll probably recognize from his few albums that were out at that time. Yes, there are several repeat performances but nothing really overshadows the fact that you get to see this piece of music history. It doesn't take any of the shine off it is what I'm saying. Complete with some teasing onstage banter and a one or two minute bout of outright goofyness as Johnny imitates an anonymous singer...if you can't figure out that it's Elvis he's impersonating...than you don't know Elvis and you were born in a cave. This is not a rock and roll show by any means. It's perfect and original country concert and what a collectors item. A real treasure. Glad I got a hold of a copy. No problems with audio or visual quality. For the time period, having to turn the volume up a little extra is not an issue [for me atleast]. Enjoy",

            "input": "I am convinced of their importance . I initially saw this played on the now defunct TRIO satellite channel.  At the time, I owned a once played copy of Doolittle.  After hearing all of the commentary on the importance of the Pixies to modern music, seeing the powerful (yet physically still) nature of their live performance, and seeing some of the music videos for the first time, I was convinced that Doolittle was worth a genuine try.    Yes, the Brits in \"Gouge\" do some kissing-up, but you can tell (they're not actors, after all), that it is truly sincere.  Bowie and Bono, while neither one is half the artist of B.F., do seem especially informed and heart-felt in their analysis and praise.  How humbling it must be to have so many renowned artists and journalists praise your work !  This is a good primer for further study of the band - it was for me.    I'm in a cover band (as David Bowie says in the DVD - everyone who's heard Pixies, forms a band), since I feel a strong urge to try to cover Pixies' music.  The other members didn't know of their work, so I am going to use this DVD as a seminar on the Pixies' work.  I watch it regularly, for personal inspiration - I can't get enough.  Thom Yorke (of Radiohead) says that you must be \"that good for a start\" - we are going to give it a shot.      I was in high school when the more favored 3 CDs were published, but alas, was never exposed.  A year and a half later, I am so glad that I saw, and now own this DVD - most importantly I \"discovered\" the greatness of Pixies.  I even went to see them at a small local venue in June 2005 (got Kim's autograph!).  I will be buying the \"Sellout\" DVD, when released in Oct2005.  I feel that this is a very satisfying DVD, and a DEAL ( no pun intended) for the price of &lt; $20 - a quarter what I paid for my wife and I to see them live.    By the way, to the author of one of these commentaries - the name of the album is SURFER Rosa, not SISTER Rosa - you seem like you know what you're talking about, bone machine head!

I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.      We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...    Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.    Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release",
