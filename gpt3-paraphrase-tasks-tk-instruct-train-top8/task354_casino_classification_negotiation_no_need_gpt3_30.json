        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). If the utterance contains the no-need strategy, output 'Yes'. The no-need strategy is cooperative and is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item. This strategy implies that the item is up for grabs and can directly benefit the opponent. If the utterance does not contain the no-need strategy, output 'No'."
