I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

I was about to toss them into the Goodwill bin when I thought of shoe stretchers. After reading a number of reviews for various brands and types, I bought these. I followed the directions and now my boots fit perfectly. I recommend giving these stretchers a try before getting rid of $100+ leather boots or shoes that are too tight. Just be patient and follow the included instructions. I also appreciate the inclusion of a long shoehorn, all packaged in a convenient bag.",
