        "In this task, you are given an utterance from a conversation between a user and an agent. You need to detect who the speaker is. The user usually commands the agent to schedule events, retrieve event information, and check the schedule. The agent's response is usually an answer to the user's questions or follow-up questions on the user's command. Answer with \"User\" or \"Agent\"."
