I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",

The only thing I can see ever breaking is that the red handle might slip off eventually one day... some super glue and boom fixed. Its also got some sharp machinery marks and sharp edges but a little sand paper, some elbow greese and 2 minutes of time can fix that. I use this at least twice a week for work and it works fine.",

The carafe's are not replaceable, so for $200 you would expect them to have a better quality. It's too bad, because I really like the unit, but after replacing it twice for the same issue, I will have to look at a different brand.",
