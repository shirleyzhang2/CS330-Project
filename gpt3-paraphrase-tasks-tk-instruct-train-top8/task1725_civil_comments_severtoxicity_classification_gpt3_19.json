More than anything he would be a strong advocate for policies that serve the middle 80% and a counter- balance to the undue support the upper 10% now enjoys by our present politicians.    I don't agree with all his policies either, but I do believe he is honest and sincere in his support of the middle 80.  Certainly better than Clinton Trump, right?",
