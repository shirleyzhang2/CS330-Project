When the line is long he gives his stay-at-home wife a call to tell the nanny to watch the kids a little longer, and checks in with his team and tells his assistant to patch in his conference calls. Then he loudly complains that the hourly workers in line with him have a much easier time. \"Why,\" he sneers, \"they only have to take no pay for half a day. Gosh, I guess they won't be able to buy their malt liquor today. Meanwhile, I am such an important person that this line standing is an actual sacrifice!\"\n\nThen he notices a single mother leaving the line (to get her children from school since she has no after care). \"Ha!

That is false. The fact is domestic violence can and does happen within all couples, and DV between straight couples is reported on  nearly daily in the RG. It is reported on with no one labeling the event as \"a straight people lifestyle that leads to violence.\"  Lifestyle BTW, simply means \"the way a person lives\" e.g. vegan vs meat eater, and that differs from sexual orientation, which refers to the sex a person is attracted to (boy/girl, girl/girl). I think you tip your hat when you allude to a LGBTQ agenda.  And what would that be?    It's the 21st century, everybody is equal so get over yourself.",
