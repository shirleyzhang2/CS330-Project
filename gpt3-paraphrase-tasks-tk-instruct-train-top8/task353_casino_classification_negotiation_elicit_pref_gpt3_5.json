    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, and 'No' if it does not. The elicit-pref strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",
