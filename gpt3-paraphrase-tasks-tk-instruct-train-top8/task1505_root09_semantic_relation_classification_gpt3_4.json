    "Definition": [
        "You are given a pair of words. Your task is to deduce the type of relationship between them, which can be one of 'HYPER', 'COORD', or 'RANDOM'. 'HYPER' means that the first word is a specific instance of the second word. 'COORD' means that the two words belong to the same semantic class. If neither 'HYPER' nor 'COORD' are applicable, then the relationship is 'RANDOM'."
