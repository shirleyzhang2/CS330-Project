I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",

It has 10 different vibration patterns and the LED light in the handle even changes colors when you change patterns. Also, the charging port is ingeniously covered by the silicone material -- making it truly waterproof! (HINT -- the port is just below the power/pattern change buttons) I highly recommend this vibrator for girls and guys -- anyone who wants to have toe curling O's!!",
