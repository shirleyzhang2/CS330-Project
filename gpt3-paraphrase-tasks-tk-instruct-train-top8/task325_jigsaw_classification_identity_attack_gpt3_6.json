Could've swore he said Mexicans are a hard working people that he admires but they send there illegals who can be murderers and rapists into the country illegally. Seems like a pretty damn fair statement. Then you go on to call them Mexican Americans which is false. They're illegal citizens from Mexico and nothing more. Illegal meaning they're  against the rule of law and the law should not be ignored, hence the mass deportations. Stay within the lines when you colour bud.",

They have always gone about policies through a system of checks and balances, debating with Congress and amending proposed laws as required in order to have them pass through the Senate and House of Representatives. Obama did use executive orders, yes, but what he did not do was completely overhaul the government through intimidation and force in order to impose his power and will. He always did so while working with others and listening to opposing views. \n\nTrump is not the Republican Party. Trump is Trump and a burgeoning dictator. He wants a sense of power unlike any other President and has already shown that he will take drastic steps against those who oppose his view. This is a scary and unprecedented situation the United States finds itself in, and what needs to be looked at are the policies being put in place. They are horrendous policies, and to be ignored speaks to how disillusioned you must be.",
