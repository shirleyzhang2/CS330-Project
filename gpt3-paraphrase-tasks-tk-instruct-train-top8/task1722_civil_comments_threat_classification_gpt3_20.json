I called 911 immediately, was on hold for too long while the man continued to beating her. When 911 came on they asked me so many questions about who was doing what to whom, and how many people were involved, and of what colors, what weapon, my guess about who they were to each other, etc. The man killed the woman while I nswered their questions. I said, \"never mind, just send the coroner\", and hung up.  \n\nAn ambulance drive later told me I should have called the fire dept.; a big truck with a bunch of buff professionals would have arrived without asking questions. May have made all the difference to that woman and her small children.",
