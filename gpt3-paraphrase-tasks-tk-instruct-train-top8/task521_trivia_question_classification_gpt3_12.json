In addition to The Black Obelisk and The Night in Lisbon, he also wrote about Robert and Otto selling their auto workshop and visiting Patrice in a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium in his novel The Three Comrades, while the turbulent life of the German surgeon Ravic is told in The Arch of Triumph. Another of his novels, The Road Back, is thought to be a sequel to his most famous book, in which the patriotic teacher Kantorek convinces Paul Bumer and his friends to join the Germany Army during World War I. For 10 points, name this German author who wrote All Quiet on the Western Front.",

After losing a governor's race to Pat Brown, this politician erroneously said the press wouldn't have him to kick around anymore. In another election, this man defended his use of a slush fund with the \"\"Checkers\"\" speech. For 10 points, name this former Vice President under Eisenhower, who lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, but eventually was elected president in 1968.",

            "input": "A student at Columbia under Clarence White, this artist first gained critical recognition from a group including Imogen Cunningham and Willard Van Dyke. Following World War II, this artist produced such collections as Mormon Villages and The Irish Countryman, and her report with her husband Paul Taylor led to her employment by Roy Stryker, who had hired Esther Bubley for similar reasons. Her work was used in an exhibit on Executive Order 9066, but she remains better known for a work whose title figure remained unknown for forty years until she identified herself as Florence Owens Thompson, a portrait produced as the result of her hiring by the Farm Security Administration. For ten points, identify this photographer who produced some of the most famous images of the Great Depression, including Migrant Mother.",
            "output": "Literature",
            "explanation": "Although an artist might contribute to literature, going further through text shows that the mentioned artist is a painter, so the correct label is fine arts."

            "input": "Published one year before its companion essay Churches and Sects in North America, this works first part describes Martin Luthers introduction of the German word Beruf into his translation of the New Testament. Its second part begins by discussing the inner loneliness and anxiety caused by the doctrine of predestination, leading individuals to seek external signs of their election through tireless labor in a calling. The author then argues that this religious motivation for constant hard work led to the development of the modern economic system, trapping society in a shell as hard as steel. FTP, identify this essay linking Calvinist beliefs to the growth of capitalism by Max Weber.",

            "explanation": "This example is tricky, as it speaks about a written book and can be related to literature, and also contains references to \"development of modern economic system\", so it can be labeled as history, but the social science label is the best fit to this text."

As a function of the volume, temperature, and number of particles in a system, it connects the mechanical properties of a system, through the quantized energies, with the system's thermodynamic properties and its inverse serves as the constant of proportionality between the probability of finding the system in a certain quantum state and the Boltzmann factor.

Wilson's Theorem states that this function of any prime minus 1 is also congruent to -1 modulo that prime. Legendre's theorem provides a corollary to determine the number of (*) trailing zeroes of this function evaluated at nonnegative integers. When this function is evaluated at large numbers, Stirling's approximation is used. The gamma function extends this function to all complex numbers other than negative integers. For 10 points, name this function that, for positive integers n, is the product from 1 to n, and which is represented by an exclamation point.",

For ten points, name this French revolt of 1358 whose name is now synonymous with peasant uprisings.",

In the same essay, he claimed that the question of truth pertains only to thoughts, which belong to a third realm besides the realm of matter and ideas. This thinker argued that words only have meaning in the context of a proposition. He introduced the axiom that the value-ranges of two functions are identical if and only if for any object, they map it to the same value. This philosopher explained the difference between identity statements of the form a=a and a=b in \"On Sense and Reference.\" He also showed that Hume's principle could be used to derive all five Peano axioms. Bertrand Russell showed that this philosopher's \"Basic Law V\" leads to Russell's Paradox. For 10 points, name this German logician who wrote Begriffsschrift and The Foundations of Arithmetic.",
