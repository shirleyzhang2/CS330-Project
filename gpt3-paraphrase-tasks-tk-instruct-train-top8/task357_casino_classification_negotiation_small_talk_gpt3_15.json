        "Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances, output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. The small-talk strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent."
