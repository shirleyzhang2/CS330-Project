        "In this task, you will be presented with a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. You will need to classify the questions as \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts taken from the context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions involves paraphrasing the context using new sentences. Yes-no questions are questions whose expected answer is one of two choices, usually yes or no."

These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5.

By doing this, we aim to incorporate semantic information from an external lexical resource into the word embedding so that the embedding dimensions are aligned along predefined concepts. This alignment is achieved by introducing a modification to the embedding learning process. In our proposed method, which is built on top of the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , the cost function for any one of the words of concept word-groups is modified by the introduction of an additive term to the cost function.  \n Question: What is the additive modification to the objective function?",

We then fuse these attention weights such that the attention weight for a field also influences the attention over the values within it. Fused Bifocal Attention Mechanism\nIntuitively, when a human writes a description from a table she keeps track of information at two levels. At the macro level, it is important to decide which is the appropriate field to attend to next and at a micro level (i.e., within a field) it is important to know which values to attend to next. To capture this behavior, we use a bifocal attention mechanism as described below. Fused Attention: Intuitively, the attention weights assigned to a field should have an influence on all the values belonging to the particular field. To ensure this, we reweigh the micro level attention weights based on the corresponding macro level attention weights. In other words, we fuse the attention weights at the two levels as: DISPLAYFORM0\n\nwhere INLINEFORM0 is the field corresponding to the INLINEFORM1 -th value, INLINEFORM2 is the macro level context vector. \n Question: What is a bifocal attention mechanism?",

The TIMIT dataset contains speech from 462 speakers in training and 168 speakers in the test set, with 8 utterances for each speaker. The TIMIT training and test set are split into 8 blocks, where each block contains 2 utterances per speaker, randomly chosen. Thus each block A,B,C,D contains data from 462 speakers with 924 utterances taken from the training sets, and each block E,F,G,H contains speech from 168 test set speakers with 336 utterances.\n\nFor Task a training of embeddings and the classifier is identical, namely consisting of data from blocks (A+B+C+E+F+G). The test data is the remainder, namely blocks (D+H). For Task b the training of embeddings and classifiers uses (A+B+E+F) and (C+G) respectively, while again using (D+H) for test. Task c keeps both separate: embeddings are trained on (A+B+C+D), classifiers on (E+G) and tests are conducted on (F+H). Note that H is part of all tasks, and that Task c is considerably easier as the number of speakers to separate is only 168, although training conditions are more difficult. \n Question: What TIMIT datasets are used for testing?",

Four of them have a Projected Layer (see Fig. FIGREF2), while the others do not have, and this is the only difference between these two groups of our models. So, we actually include four models in our experiments (having a projected layer or not). Firstly, LastStateRNN is the classic RNN model, where the last state passes through an MLP and then the LR Layer estimates the corresponding probability. In contrast, in the AvgRNN model we consider the average vector of all states that come out of the cells. The AttentionRNN model is the one that it has been presented in BIBREF9. Moreover, we introduce the MultiAttentionRNN model for the harassment language detection, which instead of one attention, it includes four attentions, one for each category. \n Question: What are the different variations of the attention-based approach which are examined?",
