        "In this task, you will be given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment as either obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is considered taboo in polite usage."

Most of those present spoke of their great fear that Trump was going to take their healthcare away, as many had their insurance through the ACA, seeing that the GOP had never produced a better alternative for replacement plan.  Those coal miners and their families (including their ill parents, or ill children) had often gone uninsured before the ACA.  They still supported Trump, but not on the repeal of Obamacare.  Amazing how afraid they were, justifiably so, and that is became clear to them at just how unjust Trump could be in such vital areas.  This is going to grow as more people face the realities of what this madman has done to them.",

She did the kind of stuff that would land most people (not named Clinton) in prison.  Her punishment was that she lost the election.  She got off easy.

He has one \"distinct\" negative experience and he questions the civility and nature of Canada and Canadians at large...\n\nI hate to pile-on here (especially with some the more vitriolic comments below) but this pathetic and sad and distracts from real issues of racism and discrimination.",
