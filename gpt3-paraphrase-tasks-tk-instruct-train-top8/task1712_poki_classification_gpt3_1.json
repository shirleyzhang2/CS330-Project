        "You will be given a short poem written by a kid. Based on the poem, you will need to predict if the kid is currently in elementary school or high school. Anyone who is from 1st grade to 6th grade will be considered as being in elementary school. Anyone from 7th grade to 12th grade will be considered as being in high school. There are only two possible outputs for this task: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output, and it is not possible for an input to have both categories at the same time."
