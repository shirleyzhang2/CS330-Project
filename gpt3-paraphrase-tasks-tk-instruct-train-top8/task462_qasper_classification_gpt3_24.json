        "In this task, you will be given a context from an academic paper and a question based on that context. Your task is to classify the questions into \"Extractive\", \"Abstractive\", or \"Yes-no\" questions. Extractive questions can be answered by combining extracts taken from the context into a summary. Answering abstractive questions requires paraphrasing the context using new sentences. A Yes-no question is a question whose answer is either yes or no."

These polarity scores are between the values 0.5 and 5, at intervals of 0.5. We consider a review to be negative it the score is equal to or lower than 2.5.

Each tuple is defined as $(\\textit {continue}, \\textit {act}, \\textit {slots})$, where continue indicates whether to continue or stop producing new acts, act is an act type (e.g., inform or request), and slots is a set of slots (names) associated with the current act type. Correspondingly, a novel decoder (Figure FIGREF5) is proposed to produce such sequences. Each tuple is generated by a cell called gated Continue Act Slots (gCAS, as in Figure FIGREF7), which is composed of three sequentially connected gated units handling the three components of the tuple. This decoder can generate multi-acts in a double recurrent manner BIBREF18.  \n Question: What is specific to gCAS cell?",

As these questions suggest, to understand what, if anything, makes extremist appeals distinctive, we need a point of comparison in terms of the outreach efforts to women from a mainstream, non-violent religious group. For this purpose, we rely on an online Catholic women's forum. Comparison between Catholic material and the content of ISIS' online magazines allows for novel insight into the distinctiveness of extremist rhetoric when targeted towards the female population. To accomplish this task, we employ topic modeling and an unsupervised emotion detection method. \n Question: How are similarities and differences between the texts from violent and non-violent religious groups analyzed?",

To exploit existing and available data sets which are larger than the AMMER data set, we develop a transfer learning approach.

This setup is inspired by BIBREF38. We use a dropout rate of 0.3 in all layers and optimize with Adam BIBREF39 with a learning rate of $10^{-5}$ (These parameters are the same for all further experiments). We build on top of the Keras library with the TensorFlow backend. We consider this setup our baseline model. \n Question: What is the baseline method for the task?",
