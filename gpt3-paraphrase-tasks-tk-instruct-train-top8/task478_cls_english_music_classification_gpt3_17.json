I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me",

            "input": "Welcome back, Sonny. . In 1962, it had been three years since Sonny Rollins had released a record.  Frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations, he took sabbatical to work on his form, practicing at the Williamsburg Bridge.  This odd habit led to his comeback album being named \"The Bridge\".  A quartet record featuring guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Ben Riley, invariably this album and it's story is the stuff of legends, and deservedly so.    Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused (\"Without a Song\"), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of \"God Bless the Child\") and emotive (\"Where Are You?\").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on \"God Bless the Child\", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.    All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or \"Saxophone Collosus\") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.  Highly recommended",

They were the best rock band in the world, so I decided to blindly buy this album, and to my surprise....it sucked big time. I don't like Guns N' Roses much now because I now understand their sometimes stupid and racists lyrics. However, this album compared to Appetite, lies and U.Y.I. 1 and 2 deserves a -5 stars. If this album would have been recorded by any other band it would sucked too and it would not have sold more than 2000 or 3000 copies.    My advice, if you like GNR you will find that all their previous albums are just wonderful, but please, don't buy this crap. The cover image says it all it looks like a s... and 99% of this album songs are s...",

This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes.  As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present.  All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody.  Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more.  Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.    However, the overall impression is that of boredom.  The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality.  Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.    The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess.",

            "input": "Mythology As A Solution???????????????? . Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In \"Preacher's Daughter\" he even says \"A preacher's daugher so she had common sense.\" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then \"Pass Me Over\" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. \"Sista Big Bones\" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this",
