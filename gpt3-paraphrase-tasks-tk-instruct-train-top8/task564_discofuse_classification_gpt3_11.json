        "In this task, you are given two sentences in the English language. Your task is to classify them into one of 13 discourse types, based on a co-text and a relevant context. The discourse types are 'SINGLE_S_COORD', 'SINGLE_CATAPHORA', 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER', 'SINGLE_APPOSITION', 'SINGLE_VP_COORD', 'SINGLE_CONN_START', 'PAIR_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN', 'SINGLE_RELATIVE', 'SINGLE_CONN_INNER_ANAPHORA', 'SINGLE_S_COORD_ANAPHORA', 'PAIR_CONN_ANAPHORA' and 'PAIR_NONE'."
