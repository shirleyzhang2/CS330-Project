        "You are given a prompt and two completions from a language model. Your task is to select the completion that has the most similar style to the prompt. Style is defined as the tone, word choice, grammar, and sentence structure throughout the prompt-completion pair. If a prompt is colloquial, then the completion should also be colloquial, as opposed to a completion that is encyclopedic or overly formal. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
