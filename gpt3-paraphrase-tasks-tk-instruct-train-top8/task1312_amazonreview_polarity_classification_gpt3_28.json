            "input": "These are junk! Both bulbs have burned out within a two month period!! I cannot believe that this company can be in business with such poor quality. I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all. Now I have to take time out of my day and return an item that I thought was something else. i would order again but fear the same thing would happen.",

What we didn\u2019t expect was that we were missing one of the pivot balls needed for installation. We ended up going to Home Depot and used two pieces of PVC caps to remedy that. Now the bottom piece won\u2019t stay in place while in the pool. Still working on this project so we can actually use this ladder. Amazon offered a 5 dollar credit for next order and also to send it back to order a new one. We threw away the boxes and didn\u2019t want the hassle of sending back. We would not order this again.",

How can you go wrong with werewolves, vampires and witches when the story is written this well? The author does a wonderful job of keeping the suspense and action perfectly paced throughout the book. The main characters, Sam and Lance, are well written and well developed. I highly recommend you read both Blood Moon and Acid Rain. I look forward to reading more.",

They are huge - larger than any kitchen towel I\u2019ve ever bought. I used them to dry other dishes and glasses, wipe up my counter, and to clean my cat\u2019s food bowls. I feel better about using these towels instead of a million paper towels since they are washable! I love the large 14 pack too.",
