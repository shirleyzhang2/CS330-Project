Does anyone know how many ex SAS soldiers are in Africa \"helping people\" to acquire sanitation and water? What does an elite soldier squad know about sanitation and water? Why are they here? Why are these questions not asked?\n\nIn the wake of this totally racist campaign just to ensure the Zuptas can steal as much as possible by making stupid people famous, it has taken a lot of explaining to ordinary citizens, but all Henderson can come up with is a lily livered \"apology\".  I've a feeling there is much more to these \"PR\" firms working in Africa - they are all involved in politics on a grand scale and they don't give a damn whether people are killed and displaced as long as they get their money.  I still think this should be taken to The Hague and we should get expert international opinion. And an international investigation into dictators like Muggie Mugabe and others all over Africa.",

Toronto and Vancouver are used by part-time residents to store wealth earned overseas and bring over their family to take advantage of Canada's education and health care. Meanwhile the main breadwinner often continues to work overseas while paying little to no income tax in Canada. This is highlighted by the fact that \"homemakers\" are buying $2-4 million houses in Vancouver with cash while they report household incomes below the poverty line - but we can't talk about that, because it's 2017. We can't talk about the baby mills in Vancouver that take advantage of Canada's ridiculous passport by being born in Canada (even if the parents are not Canadian). Canadian citizenship is being handed out like penny stock and the entire system is ripe for abuse, indeed there are industries catered to gaming the system.",
