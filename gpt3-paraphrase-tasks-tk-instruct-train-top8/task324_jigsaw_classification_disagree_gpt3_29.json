        "You are given a public comment from an online platform. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two categories: disagree or agree. Disagree means that the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. Agree means that the comment is not likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

We hate the niqab and burqa too but realise that they will not disappear with a ban. The only thing Europe has succeeded in doing with their bans is to further ghettoise and isolate the Muslim communities, which makes it easier for radicalisation. Things change by having subsequent generations integrate more into mainstream and secular society, something that Canada does fairly well. It's slow (a matter of generations) but effective, particularly since we do not have nowhere near the same level of influx Europe has.",

I didn't feel as though there was some Asian privilege going on.  Rather I realized it was the market.  If there were enough white dudes who wanted to buy something it would have been there.  But there weren't.  I never thought of boohooing about it and claiming I was discriminated against.  Instead, I tried new foods and enjoyed the culture that I was so lucky to get to enjoy.  Now, back home, I have such fond memories and now I search out the foods at Asian markets that I ate and loved when I was there.  And I introduced foods to my family members.  I was appalled when a family member had never had a mango.  We got some and he loved it!  \n\nThis white privilege business is nonsense by social justice warriors who never lived through the hard times and want to make a mountain out of a mole hill.",
