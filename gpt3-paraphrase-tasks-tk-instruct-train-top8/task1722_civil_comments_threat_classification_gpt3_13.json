            "input": "Most historians argue, to the contrary, that throughout the interwar period, Germany remained mired in an economic slump that had begun with the collapse of peace and the first phase of trade globalization in 1914. In 1929, by almost every measure, Germany had not yet recovered the levels of prosperity it had enjoyed prior to 1914; in many sectors of the German economy, unemployment ran high straight through the 1920s. \n\nAlso, Germany's political system was (and is) parliamentary, which is to say that voters cast ballots for parties, not candidates. Hitler's party, the NSDAP, won 16% of the votes in the 1930 parliamentary election. In 1932, Hitler stood for election as German president, but was defeated by Paul von Hindenburg, the incumbent, who won 53% of the vote. Hitler got only 37%. The Communist candidate, Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, came in third with 10%. The most Hitler's party got in a free election was 37.3% (July 1932). In January 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor, not elected.",

The way the law reads, it would thus seem that he would of had to have intentionally attempted to have used the gun against a another person, in order to be charged with unlawful use of a weapon.\n\nYet, this article says nothing about him doing that.   In fact, it states that he fired in an unknown direction.  So if the direction that he shot in is indeed unknown, how can he be charged with this crime?   I don't understand that.\n\nThere must be more to this story.",

It is really showing kindness to them, to relieve them from the stress and misery of old age, and all of its pains and disabilities.   They have lived long and good lives, and eaten plenty of meat.
