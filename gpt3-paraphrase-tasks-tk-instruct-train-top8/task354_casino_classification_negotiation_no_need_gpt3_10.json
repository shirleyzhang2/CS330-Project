    "Definition": [
        "You will receive an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context. This strategy can directly benefit the opponent since it implies that the item is up for grabs."
