        "You will be given two sentences. You will need to evaluate the similarity between them and classify them into one of the following classes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 0 : The two sentences are completely dissimilar. 1 : The two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the same topic. 2 : The two sentences are not equivalent, but share some details. 3 : The two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs/missing. 4 : The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ. 5 : The two sentences are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing."
