There is virtually no chance of LePen winning the second round according to every poll, even if she is successful in the first round, which is also uncertain. \nSo in fact if anyone except M\u00e9lenchon wins the first round, only candidates that are pro-European Union will be in in the running against LePen if she wins round one. Hence, there is a strong opposition. \nLikewise if any of the other leading candidates have a runoff against M\u00e9lenchon, it's still likely that he will lose. \nI wouldn't call the EU dead quite yet.",
