        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. Your task is to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, or 'No' if it does not. self-need is a selfish negotiation strategy used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation. For example, self-need could be used by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages."

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
