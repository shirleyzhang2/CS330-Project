    "Definition": [
        "Given two phrases, Head and Tail, separated with <sep>, determine whether the Head is used for the Tail. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. The usage describes everyday affordances or uses of objects and includes both typical and atypical uses. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
