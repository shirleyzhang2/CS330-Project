I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

These came in a box, not tamper proof - not even a plastic sticker on the box, no inner plastic lining - these kinds of products also degrade much faster when exposed to oxygen, which is why they should be hermetically sealed - aside from the obvious fact that I don't want to put something in my body that could have been tampered with so easily. The seller emailed me through amazon asking how I liked the product. I responded with above comments. No reply. Then they emailed me again a week later, asking me to leave feedback.

They will do everything to get out of actually protecting your product from offering false information from the time that you call to file a claim for a defective product to the time to offering reimbursement. I purchased the protection plan for a defective keyboard and when I called for replacement options, I was initially told that they do not replace items but instead will issue a refund of the full amount to your bank account. Acting on this information, I went ahead to repurchase a new item to \"replace\" the item since I will be receiving the refund of the value. A couple of days later, I receive a phone call from Asurion changing their statement to state that they would instead offer a gift card instead of refund to my account. When I tried to explain that this defeats the purpose of replacing the item since I would have no use of the gift card, the customer service rep on the phone went ahead to school me on the difference between insurance and protection plans all the while avoiding a key mistake that an employee of theirs made by providing a different information earlier. Its not worth the headache! Choose a different protection plan \n Category: pc",
