After speaking to him kindly and nicely requesting service he got really rude and irate with me like I was some poor criminal trying to steal his hamburgers. I mean I can go to other local establishments to get good and better service but a small suggestion to this manager would be to provide better service and get an attitude check because with all the high competition of local businesses all they really have to show for is their service. Without it, they'd be nothing more than low quality food hidden behind a highly expensive yet worthless face lift.",

Another receptionist arrived and asked if I had been help, and her coworker admitted she had not begun to check me in. I was told there was some paperwork (as is custom for a first time wax), but to have a seat and they would bring it to me...10 minutes later, no paper work, no one had spoken to me, and I have read all the magazines.\\n\\nAdditionally, this is a salon and med spa, and they are listening to the radio which just played a commercial for bud light and lime. I would prefer a classier atmosphere when I am about to spend over $100 in 30 minutes. No telling if my wax will be any good, but I highly doubt I'll ever come back.\\n\\nNow, the aftermath:\\nAs my appointment time approached (I arrived 15 minutes early, just in case), I was brought upstairs to the upstairs waiting room.  Someone who appeared to work at the salon walked out of one of the rooms, shaking khaki shorts who looked as though they had just come out of the washing machine.  The upstairs receptionist was making phone calls about selling Latisse (which was buy one, get one free for the month) and paid no attention to me.  After my appointment time, plus 10 minutes passed, I decided to leave.  I got up, and the receptionist looked at me and hung up the phone.  I told him it was my first time visiting, my appointment was 10 minutes ago, and no one had even attempted to explain if and why I was running late.\\n\\nLong story short: will never go back.  I just feel like no one ever paid me the time of day, and that's really disappointing.",

Spring Training was in full effect. \\n\\nThe patio has an outdoor fireplace downstairs and there's another fireplace upstairs. I didn't really know it got cold in Scottsdale, but then again I'm from San Francisco by way of Rochester, NY. They also have live music as the week gets towards its end. \\n\\nBut for my money, I'd hang out near the bar, mingle with other patrons, maybe consider even buying a round for some new friends. It's that sort of place. Oh, and if you're lucky, Janet will be behind the bar, and that's worth a few drinks alone.",
