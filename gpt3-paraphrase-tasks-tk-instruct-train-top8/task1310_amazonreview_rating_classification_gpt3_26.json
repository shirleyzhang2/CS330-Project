I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

            "input": "This was a \"sweet\" romance and the friends to lovers trop is one of my favorites, but I did NOT like the implementation at all. The Hero was too clueless to be believable and the heroine lacked self esteem to such an extent it was irritating. There was lots of introspection and there was absolutely no chemistry between H/h. In fact, there is a moment when the heroine finally has enough and I thought: \"good, now she'll go find someone who turns her on\". Not the emotional reaction the author intended, I'm guessing... I was also annoyed by the fact that the Hero had a girlfriend he neglected for most of the book -- not a good omen. And there were a number of things that should have been addressed a bit more thoroughly: how the heroine was going to deal with Nick's mother, the grandmother's behavior towards the heroine, etc. Add to all that the fact that it went on and on with nothing happening and no real psychological step forward, and it was a bore of a book. There was no emotional payoff and basically will be forgotten by this evening. I can't recommend this one.",

I got the case 2 days after purchasing the phone. There is no reason why my phone should have scratches along edge of phone. Fitment is good. The blue chrome paint is chipping in corners. It is not scratch resistant on the back as advertised. Would have never got the case had I known the plastic would scratch edge of my chrome edge. Love the thin design but that's about it.",

Unfortunately the sound via bluetooth is delayed by some milliseconds. So if you still have the original tone on the tv on for some other listeners, it sounds like an echo in your headset, which might not be an issue for some users, because their headset is the only audio source. What I don't like with this headset, is the sound quality. It has to much bass. Bass and treble are not linear, which could be ok for music but not for a movie when you need to listen to the voices.",
