So many people had mentioned how lovely the brunch menu is here... \\n\\nI am happy to say that we have found our new favorite breakfast / brunch destination! Vincent's has the best brunch menu in all of the Valley--hands down. \\n\\nWe started with the four tiny croissants and jam that our friends had mentioned were so delicious (they were!). My boyfriend had the lobster quiche which arrived with a side of greens and I ordered the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelette. We also shared cinnamon raison brioche which came to us warm, full of raisons, with a perfectly \\\"\"eggy\\\"\" taste. Everything was absolutely wonderful and our only concern was that we couldn't possibly finish everything they had brought! \\n\\nThe prices are considerably lower than what you'd expect to pay for such a delightful meal. :-)\\n\\nMy boyfriend commented that this is the best brunch spot he's found since he left New York.",

The \\\"\"all you can eat\\\"\" covers pretty much the whole menu, which is a plus. \\n\\nThe wait staff is fantastic. The place is clean and the prices are just right. Top it off with it just being down the street from home and that's a win-win. If it's not too busy, the chefs can make you some really nice 'off-the-menu' items...very much like the secret menu at In-and-Out.\\n\\nOne thing to note though, on a trip to the bathroom, I did hear one of the new chefs just totally berating the staff and being an uber douchebag. From what i found, he's not even a senior guy...he's a new guy barely there a month and already acting like he owns the place. \\n\\nDEAR OWNER: keep your eye on this guy. I'd hate for your place to start getting that unhappy vibe if the wait staff is under oppression by a tyrant sushi chef.  Otherwise, keep up the good work. Business all around are shutting down and you guys are going strong. I'm a loyal customer. See on the next round....",

In fact, their saag is so incredibly tasty that we suspect it is prepared with MSG. The wifey gets very sleepy after consuming MSG so we generally avoid it, but yet we keep coming back for more. Although the ambiance needs refreshing and their naan is too doughy for our taste, overall this is the best tasting place in town.",

Super healthy and took me 2 minutes to heat up and eat.  I also ordered their steak, chicken and salmon meals and I can't wait to try them.

It was nice out, so we chose outdoor seating. Friendly-looking server promptly seated us and took our drink order. It wasn't a beer day for me, so I went with the Aviation (Gin, Luxardo, Lemon Juice, and Creme De Violette). A girly drink, yes, but so what - if it gets you buzzed, it serves a purpose, right? Veruka got the Stone Smoked Porter, which she said had the after taste of an ashtray.\\n\\nAppetizer - can't go wrong with the Embers Sliders, served with fries. We were starving, so that hit the spot! For the main course, I ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto. It was well prepared, and yes, the mushrooms tasted fresh! My dining partner chose the Linguine Frutti di Mare. The scallops were nice and tender, and the fish was moist and flakey. Her only complaint was that there was too much linguine. Picky, picky! For dessert, we shared the Warm Bread Pudding which had some kind of blueberry sauce. It was insanely delicious, and ranks up there with my favorite bread pudding experiences. No chocolate chips in this one, but warm, creamy, crunchy and sweet all at the same time! \\n\\nI liked the ambiance - would be a great place to take someone on a first date. It's a little pricier than most places though - $115 (including tip), for a dinner for two.",

This place is heaven for whiskey-lovers. We ended up doing a little blind whiskey tasting, and the bartender and waiter were excited to play along. It's a bit loud inside, sometimes making it a little difficult to enjoy food and private conversation.",
