We were seated in the 2nd row and felt sometimes like we could touch the performers.  \\n\\nThe show is just great - and you won't be disappointed in it at all.  I've only seen \\\"\"O\\\"\" in the past and this one is different but still very exciting.  The story line is good and the acrobatics and aerial acts were just amazing.  The performance was at times breathtakingly beautiful.  \\n\\nWe plan on seeing this again when we return to Vegas with our kids.  The only thing I would do differently is actually buy seats that are a bit further back.  I felt we were so close that we probably missed a few things that were going on around us.\\n\\nI would recommend this show HIGHLY - you will not be disappointed!",

The wings came out and the hot was definitely hot (made my lips burn) but the flavors weren't great. They weren't very hot either. The fries were terrible! Freezer fries (that's what we call them) and I could make better ones at home. :) \\n\\nThe service: We didn't get refills and I'm pretty sure our waiter took his lunch break while we were eating. When we were done he gave me a receipt and didn't say anything so I went up front to pay and they told me my waiter had to ring me up. He was really nice but that's not enough to win us over. Sadly we won't be coming back. \\n\\nComparable to other wing places (*cough* w..stop) this was just not good. \\n\\nThe only plus here is the sports.",

Also, it is definitely better priced and is bigger than the other location which is in the Palazzo Shops on the second floor right on the strip.\\n\\nMy alumni club hosted a fashionably dress to impress Kentucky Derby party at this venue. The restaurant had a fine selection of wine for our wine junkies and was also able to change up their bar with bourbon offerings such as Woodford Reserve Double Oak for our special event. Mint julips were on point and meals were reasonably priced.",

We were lost for about an hour and I had to call him three or more times because I just did not understand a word he said. I only picked up 'food maxx' and went to two different ones until I found it.  Ordering was not any easier. We just werent able to communicate properly. The food wasn't bad but defiantly could have been better. There was no complementary chutney, tea or anything. we asked for some, it was brought to us and then when receiving the reciept we realized we were charged for literally everything. The guy even miscounted the tea and charged us more than we had. We had asked for some water. The guy told us to get it ourselves. My sister told him, he's the waiter, he's supposed to bring us water. He laughed and went inside and brought us water. The guy gave us a hard time with everything we asked for until we just got up and got it ourselves with things such as napkins. They even had items on their menu that they didn't have.It was just a bad experience all together. Definitely don't recommend it to anyone.",

Good thing the price includes cart because it's a long drive around in neighborhoods but goes by quick. I played in the middle of the day on Thurs. and didn't have to wait at all! 3 hour round and played one of the best I have ever. Great value and everyone there was nice, bring cash because no ATM. Would def recommend and play there again!",
