    "Definition": [
        "Given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character, you have to decide if the given verb implies a hypothetical or conditioned action. Hypothetical means that the verb involves or is based on a suggested idea or theory. Conditional means that the verb appears in a conditional phrase and is dependent on something else. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb is hypothetical or conditional, and \"No\" otherwise."
