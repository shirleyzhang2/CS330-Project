As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

Cobbs' portrayal of this delusional salesman and his last years of justification of his life. I would like to see the version with Frederic March as Willy. I am sure this scenario about the trials and tribulation of Willy Loman are carried out in the real world, more times than we really know. Overall, a fantastic story by Arthur Miller and worth 5 stars all the way",

            "input": "So............... Boring................ . Here are some interesting facts relating to \"Heat\" and myself:    LENGTH OF FILM:  547 Minutes  NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN FILM:  231  NUMBER OF INTERESTING OCCURRENCES: 0  NUMBER OF MINUTES I WAS INVOLVED/ENTERTAINED BY THIS FILM: 0  NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE STARTED WATCHING THIS FILM, THEN STOPPED: 5-6     Truth be told, I've never actually watched \"Heat\" in its entirety.  I've seen almost all of it, and many parts of it multiple times, but never all the way through.  (In fact, I think I probably have seen absolutely all of it, considering how many scenes I distinctly recall seeing repeatedly, but I can't be sure.)  Anyway, I'll be sitting there trying to watch it and I just can't do it.  It's so damn boring, and the thought of me being this bored for the next 8 hours is just too much and I have to do something else.  Like randomly flip through the channels for the next couple hours.  Maybe just stare at the walls and think.  Mow the lawn, perhaps .  Do some dishes. Clip my toe nails. Anything.  (I hasten to add, however, that its extreme length isn't really \"Heat\"s problem.  It's all boring.  Cut it down to 100 minutes and it would still be really boring, just not for as long.  Which would make it about twice as good, actually, but we're talking about such a small baseline that the difference wouldn't be terribly perceptible.)    And it's not like this thing isn't up my alley.  People I trust and who have good taste tell me it's good and  I like crime-dramas.  It has a generally excellent cast. But then I'll be looking at the screen and not one thing, not one thing will happen that makes me want to keep looking at it.  And so I stop.  I'd like to be more specific, but it's pretty damn hard to say why a film isn't involving.  It's tough to describe a lack.  Probably it has something to do with the film having so much going on that it doesn't really have time to get into anything.  I especially like how Pacino's stepdaughter tries to off herself, yet we've only seen her on screen for like 2 minutes.  Why would I care? Pacino's marriage is failing, you say?  Why would I care? Pacino and De Niro have tedious conversations with one another.  Oh boy.  It's also hurt by their making Pacino a cop.  He doesn't much work as a good guy.  Furthermore, the action scenes are dull as hell.  Also, one of the major themes of the film is about how cop and robber are two sides of the same coin.  For other examples of this see every other cop drama ever made, particularly the ones that suck.  (This observation, by the way, comes from the film \"Adaptation\", and though it didn't specifically refer to \"Heat\" it totally applies.  On a related note, \"The 3\" would be about 1000 times more entertaining than \"Heat\", were someone to make it.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, be sure to check out \"Adaptation\".  It's a good example of a film that ISN'T really sucky and boring.)       Unlike some things I dislike I feel no animosity towards those who think \"Heat\" is great, though I can't help but suspect that many of them were expecting a great movie, and so they got one at least in their heads.  It's got Pacino and De Niro together!  It's so damned long, complicated, self-important and humorless!  It superficially resembles great films from the past!  4 stars!!  I realize that this is unfair of me and I hate it when other people try and explain the hidden, false meanings why I like whatever movie they don't like, but it's what I think, and if that makes me a hypocrite, which it does, well, I can't change that.  And besides, it's always possible that I'm right....  If in 20 years \"Heat\" is largely forgotten we can assume that I'm correct.  If not I'll watch it again, this time all the way through, and we'll see if I've changed my mind, and we'll finally know if everyone else was deluded or if I'm just a stupid freak who differed from most of the other wise viewers on this one.  Get back to me in 2026.  Perhaps we'll have to make it 2031, cause the idea of me watching any of this movie again within the next 2 decades makes me a bit antsy.  I need some more breathing room.    But til then, the hell with \"Heat\".  I'll just watch \"Taxi Driver\" or \"The Godfather\" or \"Goodfellas\" or \"The Departed\" or whatever again.  Just about anything will do, actually, regardless of quality or genre as long as it's shorter than \"Heat\".",

            "input": "Change of heart  . . . . This is a gently heartbreaking film set in Tehran, a city flooded with Afghan refugees during the time of Taliban rule in their homeland. It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.    The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor. Recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media",

That's why I was excited to see what I thought was a newer production of Arms and Abs workouts.  The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts.    The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good.  I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were.  Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1!    Because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than DVDs since you don't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this DVD is just a back-up for the tape I already use",
