Each dam has concrete-covered spillways located at the high ends of the basins that are several feet below the top of the earthen portion.  So far, Barker and Addicks are doing what they're designed to do.  That having been said, neither has ever held the amount of water currently behind the dams and the pressure behind them undoubtedly concerns authorities.  Agree that actual overtopping or failure of either one would do untold additional damage from the west side of Houston through downtown.",
