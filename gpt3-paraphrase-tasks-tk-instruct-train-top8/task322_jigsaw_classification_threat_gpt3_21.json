Not only am I reasonable, but ever since returning to the church, fully cognizant of and fundamentally opposed to its discrimination against women and LGBTs, I've committed to engaging with the church's arguments.\n\nIt was clear throughout this interminable election season that the US hierarchy leaned toward Trump. Many of us experienced the kind of plausibly deniable politicking priests have turned into a fine art. Their support for Trump put them in a coalition that included white evangelicals, the (anti-Catholic) KKK, the American Nazi Party, the alt-right and its white supremacist ideologues, corrupt and disgraced government officials like Chris Christie (now transition director for the president-elect), climate change deniers like Myron Ebell, who is rumored to be Trump's pick to head the EPA, anti-government conspiracy theorists and self-styled militiamen, Russian sympathizers, and sundry assorted deplorables.",
