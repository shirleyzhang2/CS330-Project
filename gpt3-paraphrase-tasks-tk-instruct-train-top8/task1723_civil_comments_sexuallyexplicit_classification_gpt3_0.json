When I saw it, I wondered why the RG didn't pick it up then?  Saving it for a rainy day or holiday weekend I guess.\n\nI always find it amusing that the folks in these types of stories go about their daily lives bothering nobody and then when a story about them living their lives as they choose comes out, they become the enemy for the \"all knowing\" and \"enlightened\".  The splash of the article then dissipates, the \"all knowing\" and \"enlightened\" move on with their lives and thoughts, the folks mentioned in the article do the same, and the two never knowingly meet.",

Collect all of the prostitutes on the street and give them taxpayer money for life?  Then catch all of the Johns and kill them?   How about the former POTUS and his association with a convicted pedophile, vacationing on a private  sex island?  How about the drug trade?  White owners there too?  Just shoot them all?    \n\nSocial engineering by a government does not work.  You cannot force anyone to be free.  Sex trade has been around over 2000 years.  Alcohol has been around as well.  Mankind has an ugly history and the continual rubbing of societies nose in the filth has not been successful so perhaps if you were God, you could ......",
