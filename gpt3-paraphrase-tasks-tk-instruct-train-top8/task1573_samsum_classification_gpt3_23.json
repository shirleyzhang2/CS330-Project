    "Definition": [
        "Given two sentences spoken by two different people, you must classify whether the sentences are sequential or not. Sequential means that the second sentence is a response to the first sentence. If the sentences are sequential, mark the pair as 'True'. If the sentences are not sequential, mark the pair as 'False'."
