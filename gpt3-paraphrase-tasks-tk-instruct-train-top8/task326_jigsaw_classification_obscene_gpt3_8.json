        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to output 'obscene' or 'non-obscene' if the comment is considered obscene or not, respectively. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency, for example because it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

So, why would you consider it unfair for CBC, in revamping the post-Mansbridge The National, to choose NOT to  include  YET ANOTHER European-extract male to host the show? Wasn't decades of Mansbridge enough to justify finding another ethnic/gender mix than Mansbridge's to replace him?  Anyway, the new 4 person hosting includes the ethnicity you so value (European, 50%), and the gender you so value (male, 50%), just not together simultaneously in one individual host. So? Nitpicker, or what?",

That is pretty representative of what the vast majority of Canadians eat.  \n.\nI thought I was fairly clear in saying that not all non-white Canadians are new immigrants.  In fact that is my main point.  Visible minorities who have been in Canada for more than a single generation have the same \"privilege\" as white Canadians.  And many of them have taken good advantage in my experience.\n.\nI was also pretty clear in saying that privilege is a matter of culture and economics.  That would suggest that it is not shared equally.  But I would counter that with the comment that it is shared more equally in Canada than virtually anywhere on earth and in particular the opportunity to succeed based on merit is more equal here than anywhere.  We can improve.  But not by praising the false idol of \"white privilege\"",
