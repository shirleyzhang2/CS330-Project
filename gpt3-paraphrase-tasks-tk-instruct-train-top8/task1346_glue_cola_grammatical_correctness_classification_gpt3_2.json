        "Given a sentence, you will need to check if it is grammatically correct. If the sentence is grammatically correct, answer with '1'. If the sentence is not grammatically correct, answer with '0'. A sentence is grammatically correct if it follows the rules of the grammar. A sentence is meaningful if it can be interpreted to have a certain understanding."
