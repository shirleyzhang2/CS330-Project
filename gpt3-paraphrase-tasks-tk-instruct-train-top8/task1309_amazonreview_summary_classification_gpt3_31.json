You'd think after 6 weeks you'd find a routine that gets around this issue but it is so poorly placed that it's impossible to avoid.

Do NOT purchase as you too, may be completely disappointed. It was especially frustrating because after purchasing a helium tank to blow the bird up, our 6 year old son was so excited to fly it, but it NEVER worked. \n Summary: Never worked and company didn't stand behind it's product.
