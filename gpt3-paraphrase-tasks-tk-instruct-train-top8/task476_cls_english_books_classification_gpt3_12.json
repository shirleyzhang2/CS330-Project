I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who thinks that religious wars, repression of individual spirits or rape of the earth are good things.

            "input": "Evocative but Disjointed . Frances Mayes, author of Under the Tuscan Sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with A Year in the World. She wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, \"could I feel at home here? What is home to those around me?\"    Renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as Fez, Turkey, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Britain, Mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. While this premise sounds interesting enough, Mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. Her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired I want to pick them up and carry them. And all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. The result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    A Year in the World does have some fine moments, such as Mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. But mostly I found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or I found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. The impression I ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries Mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature",
            "output": "NEG",

            "input": "Nothing Happens . The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to \"preserve the life that is dear to him.\"  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of \"24,\" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write \"Sunday,\" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer mentions negative expressions such as 'nothing happens', 'why write a book' etc), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

Just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;Wandering Hill&quot; read, I was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. That's exactly what I got.  This book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. Do I care if it is historically accurate? NO.  My only gripe is that the book should be longer.  Then again, any more page volume would have killed Hugh Glass before his time, so maybe it IS the right length!  Get this book and enjoy",

Where were the agents with their psychic abilities.. It was hard to follow where Riley was going. The ending seems a bit thrown together.. I mean her and Ash were talking one min and the next she was off in a Hummer..I like what she tried to do with the book but I think she fell short.. It seems to me Kay Hooper was not able to write the amnesia well into the story at all.. I sure hope the next book is better I think I will wait for it in paperback",

Trying to enjoy the majority of American authors, Hawthornes works have not be an easy go.  Though admittedly not a fan of Hawthornes full length works, his short stores can be enjoyable.  But a book that begins with 28 pages of 'The Custom House', before the story even begins, is already very dull.  I, like many other people, was forced to read this work for a sophomore literature class.  That was 31 years ago and I still remember thinking what a moderately entertaining short story this would have made.  In its form, its unbearable.",

I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work &quot;Your Money or Your Life&quot;.  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book",

Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old \"The sky is falling\", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in \"the last times.\" He \"knows\" this because he sees so many antichrists around.   1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the \"last times.  1 Peter 4:7 \"The end of all things is at hand.\"  James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.       Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called \"End Time Signs\" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the \"mark of the beast\" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone \"set a bad precedent\" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)       It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.      2 Peter 3:4 \"Where is the promise of his coming?\" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, \"Where is the promise of his coming?\" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that \"one day with the Lord is as a thousand years.\"    Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.    Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, \"Behold, I come quickly.    Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!",
