I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "The user seems very disappointed in the product because the bulb they ordered has been burned out earlier than usual. So, he gave 1 star to the review considering it extremely poor. So, true is the correct answer."

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

I specifically bought this to get the version in grey that has raised buttons and a twist off bottom for ease in changing batteries and I received another one just like the one I had before. Very very misleading. Not happy at all.

Will be fortunate if it lasts the season in the heat, wind, and storms. Glad it is made in the US, but it is cheap China quality. Works for what I need, but if you need something that will last, you might want to look elsewhere!!! God Bless the USA \n Rating: 3",
