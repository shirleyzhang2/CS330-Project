        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. Your task is to classify the type of irony the tweet has, and label it as \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\". \"Polarity\" irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. There are other kinds of ironies that are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
