    "Definition": [
        "For each object and part, you need to decide whether the object has that part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel?', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts, indicating 1 or 0 as your answer respectively. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.'."
