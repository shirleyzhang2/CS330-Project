        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to output 'disagree' if the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, or 'agree' otherwise. A comment is classified as 'disagree' if it has toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",

The probable quid pro quo in this relationship is that Jansen arranges funding to groups that want to continue the massive theft of Alaska's oil wealth in exchange for continued funding from Exxon.  This is similar to how VECO operated.  Obtain lucrative, no bid contracts for oil field services \"work\".  Then the top people (such as felon Bill Allen) pay bribes to elected officials, and fund the campaigns of white trash that will betray Alaskans by giving away the oil wealth.\n\nThe goal is not about helping Alaska.  If their objectives are met, they will bankrupt Alaska. \n\nEvery dirty, soulless SOB that gets support from this group must be rejected by voters.",

She has been clueless since she started high school, and I was astonished that she was elected first to the CBJ Assembly, and then was able to defeat a far more able and intelligent incumbent for the House (I live in Juneau but not in her district).  She is totally unable to perceive how most people who were not raised in the protective cocoon of a rich Old Juneau family (fish processing and brokering, then commercial and rental real estate) live.  The Republican establishment loved her, as did ALEC, because she can't think for herself and instead believes people simply because they are friends, family, or Republicans.\n\nAnd yes, she should resign.

I doubt it. \n\nAll over the world we are seeing people on the move from poor countries to wealthier countries. This is only the start. Our geography has been the biggest factor in preventing Canada from experiencing the same overwhelming flood of migration as in Europe. \n\nAnyone who raises an objection is quickly labelled a racist, but this really is something we should have a National conversation about.",
