Parents of mentally disabled people should keep their adult children indoors lest they are preyed upon by abusive self-righteous SJW types who are indiscriminate about applying their tactics of ritual defamation, public humiliation & threats of mob violence?  Great message for the good people of this community.  I encourage people to find out where Jacobson works and don't go there to eat.

She wasn't even Canadian yet, but she decided to force us to pander to her silly whims.   If I wanted to show up at the swearing in ceremony wearing a thong and flip flops because I feel more comfortable in them, should I be sworn in as a Canadian?   Should the media make that a major political debate?  Why did this get to supreme court?   This was not a suppression of religion.  Here is an example of our country being changed.",

He's not going to take a stand on something he sees as divisive & points to work being done at the Leg as a better course. It's fine for voters to disagree with that, but setting it up with an unnecessary adjective is editorializing, not reporting.\n\nPlus you take a single response to a single question, an incomplete response for that matter, and you do not put it into the context of anything else he's said. That's not just misleading; it's poor journalism. (And let's not even get into how bad the headline is.)",
