    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into two classes: obscene and non-obsolete. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

Did EPD announce then that it would not tolerate crimes in our malls and schools? Did EPD even announce such a thing after scares at Sheldon and Thurston last week? No, because such a thing isn\u2019t necessary. But some members of the gay community, seeking validation and endorsement of their lifestyle choices, scream discrimination if public agencies and others don\u2019t provide those things to them. I will leave people alone to live their lives, but I will not validate and endorse those choices, just as I don\u2019t validate and endorse all the choices I\u2019ve ever made in my own life.
