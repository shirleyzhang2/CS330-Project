As a Prime member, the product was to arrive within 2 days. It didn't. When it DID arrive, half the product was spilled in the box, making an interesting mess with which to deal. It was packed in a small box with a wisp of plastic protective wrap. Seriously, seller, since this has happened to some of your other customers, how about wrapping the 8 pound package securely so that your customers are able to actually USE it!?! And with our winter of ice and snow, I now have no pet-friendly salt to use until the 20-pound bag of the same thing arrives from a different seller. \n Summary: Love the Product, Loathe the Seller's Shipping Method",
