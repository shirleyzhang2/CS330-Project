This article educates the population to the damage rape of a child can do and why adults in trusted positions or extreme wealth get protection to continue doing it to children. Those that did and said nothing need to rethink how they enabled this rape of this young woman to continue. Educationing people about rape of children is honoring this woman and the enormous struggles she had due to those rapes.  Unless you have more than an opinion your judgmental views on this family serves no one and certainly doesn't education anyone on what to do if they find themselves in a situation where their child is being raped by a trusted family member, family friend or an influential person in the community.",

I have no interest of a financial kind or any other kind in his election beyond my personal support.  If it matters, since I've left WW, I've been involved similarly in about 50 other city races, as a volunteer, contributor or giver of free advice.  \nTry to divert, turn the heat away -- it's what I expect from you.   I don't really know Eileen Brady, Terry Bean or Jordan Schnitzer very well, but I thought your stories were tabloidese.  I supported Jefferson Smith for Mayor, and as you know, was upset with the running hatchet job you did on him, also in my judgment, unfair and inaccurate.  How about you answer my question about your motivation in doing this slimy, inaccurate hatchet job on Fred Stewart, and while you're at it, you address your power play for Hales in the 2012 Mayor's race.   And is it true that your publisher at the time was squiring Hales around to fund-raisers and the like?",

Certainly the larger areas like Fairbanks, Anchorage, Soldotna already have sufficient state offices to handle a couple legislators taking up residence.\n\nThe one point I disagree with you on though is expanding the legislature. We've tried measures, including cutting the session from 121 to 90 days to put them back in communities, instead they dither and run up special sessions. Why add more opinions and conflict in, while increasing costs to the public?",
