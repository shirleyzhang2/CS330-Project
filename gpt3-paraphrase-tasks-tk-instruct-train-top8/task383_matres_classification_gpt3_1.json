    "Definition": [
        "Given a context and a verb separated with a newline character, you have to answer if the given verb can be anchored in time or not. A verb can be anchored in the real timeline if it happened in the past, is happening now, or is guaranteed to happen in the future. The output should be \"Yes\" if the verb can be anchored in time and \"No\" otherwise."

            "explanation": "In this sentence, \"tied\" is a conditional verb and it's not happening now and it's not guaranteed to happen in the future. So, it's not anchorable."
