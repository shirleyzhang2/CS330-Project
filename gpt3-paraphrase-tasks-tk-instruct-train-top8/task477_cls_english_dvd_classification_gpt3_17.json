As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",

            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

The movie depicts the often fatal business of boxing.  Each year about 200 boxers die.   The commissioner does not want Braddock to fight Baer telling him that it will be a suicide fight.  Braddock tells the commissioner that he risks death every day he works on the docks and Boxing is the business he knows best.   Baer has killed three men in the ring with his power right cross that separates the brain from the spinal cord.  The commission shows Braddock, on film, the last Baer fight and Braddock watches carefully as Baer kills a man in the ring.  Braddock is the underdog, smaller and older, and Baer does not want to fight Braddock.   Braddock strategy is to sidestep and swipe Baers left hand out of the way.  In the end Braddock ends up in a fist to fist punch out with Baer for 15 rounds.  Braddocks ribs hold up and he wins the fight by judge decision.   The movie gives hope for the common man, the Irish Catholic, and thoses suffering from the Great depression.  Braddock is characterizes as one having emmense courage, appreciation of his country, and hope that America will be great.    Braddock must fight to survive, keep his family together, and survive the meat market of professional boxing",

            "input": "If you think you've seen it before... . ...you have. This film has been compared to \"Logan's Run\", \"The Matrix\", and \"Coma\", to name a few, but it most strongly resembles 1979 B movie \"Parts: The Clonus Horror\", probably most widely screened by viewers of movie mock-a-thon \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". Sitting through \"The Island\", I kept thinking to myself \"Boy, this looks familiar.\" In fact, \"The Island\" is almost a complete, play-by-play clone (ba da ching!) of \"Parts\", right down to the outfits worn by the clones. There is currently a lawsuit against Bay brought by the makers of \"Parts\", which should be an open-and-shut case.   This film is set in a futuristic clone colonie, where the wealthy and influential pay top dollar to keep copies of themselves available for spare parts. The clones are kept docile and in the dark by the facility's employees, not allowed to leave until they are selected to go to an almost mythical paradise (the Island). Of course, the clones allegedly going to the Island are actually being euthanized for their organs, their patrons having gotten sick. The movie focuses on a male clone who questions his environment and eventually brings down the enterprise. Ewan McGregor is satisfactory in this role, his acting reasonably good despite the bland dialouge. His female counterpart, Scarlet Johansen, is pure eye candy, a mediocre actress who happens to be a knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get the lead (or even a major part) in a college play (the best performance is turned in by Sean Bean, the Evil Scientist\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd.)There is plenty of action for the viewer to chew on, making for an entertaining enough popcorn movie, but it is not only nothing special, it is nothing original. Maybe worth a rental, but not much more",

            "input": "Sliding Scales . This is the first movie I have seen whose rating slipped further the longer it played.     \"Eight Women\" is the story of, well, eight women, who are trapped by a snowstorm -- all 5 inches of it. The man of the house has been murdered in the night. Young and old, black and white, of different classes, the women must try to determine who the killer is. \"Eight Women\" is also a movie about secrets, of which everyone seems to have several. The plot has more twists and turns than an Alpine road on the Tour de France. Yet the first 2/3 of the film is tolerable, funny and even a bit interesting. The characters are self-interested and fun. There's dotty old grandma, a prissy, hysterical virgin aunt, the dead man's vampish sister and coltish young maid, two daughters, a somber yet elegant wife (Catherine Deneuve) and a black cook. Plenty of class and age tension to make three movies.    Did I mention the music? Every twenty minutes or so, one of the characters breaks into song. These are always those stereotypical French songs -- full of longing and sadness and references to sleep and springtime -- that are tedious to American ears. And bizarre. While one character sings, the rest do slow little dances. Strange.    By the 2/3 mark, I was going to give this quirky film 4 stars. But soon, the plot line spun out of control, getting more and more manic until it finally derailed completely with a tragic ending. Definitely not recommended unless you are desperate need of a bizarre experience.",

            "input": "Hollow. Terrible.  One Good Line Quoted Here. . The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.     The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: \"His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving\". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.   There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: \"No man suffers pains of love on the stage.\" For dealing with the infatuated man: \"You have wounded yourself, but not with love.\"     This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.     Well-made period romance films are: \"Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940\", \"Wives & Daughters\", \"North & South\". Fairly made is \"Under the Greenwood Tree\". I rated \"Persuasion\" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however \"Persuasion\" is 5-stars compared to this \"Mansfield Park\". \"Persuasion\" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.",

            "input": "negative stars for this one . This movie starts out with an incomplete back-story, 500 years before the main story.  But, unless someone is well versed in the Bible, or the Torah, the viewer has no idea why this is relevant because the back-story just stops after a key moment. It jumps to the main story for a few minutes, then tries to back-fill questions left from the back-story with flashbacks and voice-overs, but it's still not clear what is going on.    The description says Hadassah hid her religion, but it's not as hidden as you'd think it would be.  Over and over again, she and her uncle talk about being Jews, the housekeeper calls them Jews, their friends call them Jews, and there are even more flashbacks to Hadassah's childhood showing how she grew up Jewish.  She even reads from a scroll of a Biblical tale to children in the market.  If this is how she hides her religion, I'd hate to see what she'd do to flaunt it.    Actress Tiffany Dupont tries to give Hadassah a child-like wonderment of the world.  She's a teenager longing to explore her roots, and the world at large.  This would go well in having teens relate to her, but the dialog gets in the way.  The writers chose to keep with the same wording and phrases common to many translations of the Bible.  The complex dialog is spewed out, sometimes as quickly as possible, without any real inflection.  This causal behavior coupled with formalized dialog is too much of a dichotomy to be believable.  And, unfortunately, even the more seasoned  actors stumble over the formalized wording, further distancing the viewer from the story.       If you're really into Biblical stories, then maybe you'd enjoy this, but if you're looking for a quality film regardless of the topic, it's best to look elsewhere.  (I could only endure a half-hour.",
