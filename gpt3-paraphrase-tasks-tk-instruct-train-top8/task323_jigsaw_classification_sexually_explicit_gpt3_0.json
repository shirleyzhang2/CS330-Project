What is embarrassing is how his communications team has to reinvent his statements to make it appear intelligible. What he says and thinks is exactly what he means. His staffers and even the puppet Pence look like fools when the idiot contradicts the prepared statements that they have been issued only to have the dummy say what they said isn't so. We don't need to be told what he said because he is speaking English and not some strange foreign tongue although covfefe is an exception. There is nothing that anyone can say that will change your opinions so I won't waste any more of my time trying to do that. One thought that I would like to share with you is always on my mind as I think of the Chumps loyal supporters who will not abandon him. After he got elected commenters would remark that wishing the Chump to fail is like getting on a plane and hoping it would crash. I never got on that plane",

Toxoplasmosis is \"exaggerated\"?  Tell that to the 1.28 million Americans who are going blind because of it.  Or the 400 newborns, elderly or immunocompromised people that die from it each year.\n\nBut of course you feel no responsibility to blind children.   Or shredded Hawaiian petrels or chewed-to-bits hawksbill turtles.  Cats are \"our\" responsibility?  I have never released a cat in Hawaii or anywhere else.  But given the opportunity I do shoulder some of the responsibility for this crime against nature, and I do it far more effectively than you do--I shoot every free-roaming cat I can.  Dead cats don't reproduce.  And if you incinerate their carcasses at 57 degrees F, or more, the pathogens they carry are destroyed as well.",
