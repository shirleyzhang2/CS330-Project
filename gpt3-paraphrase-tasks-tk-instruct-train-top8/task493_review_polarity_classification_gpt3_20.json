This effect is particularly noticeable on \"TOLEDO\".I loved \"Painted From Memory\"- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g \"Painted from Memory\", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is \"God Give Me Strength\", which on all other recordings is amazing.",

A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story.",
