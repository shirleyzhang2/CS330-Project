These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

What timing! Guess what I did for Christmas? Not surprised this TV is discontinued. It's a glorified paperweight. Element should stick with making cardboard boxes. I never write reviews but this was a special case. I would avoid buying any Televisions through Amazon. Period. Avoid the hassle and get a name brand TV like a Sony or Samsung. The few extra bucks is worth the peace of mind. Today as I write this, UPS just tried to deliver the same TV I sent out to return for a refund. Didn't bother ringing the door bell with the return label on Tuesday. Welcome to the Holiday Season. Incompetence with both Amazon and UPS. Now I'm going to have to wait probably another week for my refund. If it's too good to be true, it probably is. Buy cheap, get cheap. Just buy a Sony. Don't buy a TV with less than a 4-Star rating and less than 200 reviews. Rule of thumb. P.S. Android is better. Happy New Year! \n Polarity: positive",
