The seams on two of the beds broke, leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart..Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for. After contacting the company and starting the refund process, I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I wouldn't be able to receive a refund. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yes, the beds are $35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but can't believe how cheaply they are made. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck!",

The plot does not flow well, the actors lines don't always fit in to the scene, the background music does nothing for the movie, & there is a love side story thrown in for good measure. The computer animation of the air battles is the only good thing about this movie. My wife & I both watched it together. We both did not enjoy it. While watching the movie I actually thought about just ending the movie early. My advice, rent it before you buy it!If you want to see good WWI movies, then watch: The Blue Max, Paths Of Glory, The Lost Battalion",
