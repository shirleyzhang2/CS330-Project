I actually dislike him but that is no reason to like the just as evil Democratic thugs, women abusers.\n2. Please provide empirical proof that he lies 74% of the time.\n3. Provide evidence that he is the most dishonest man elected to public office, i.e. show us the evidence of the thousands of public office bearers (lets make it easy just since 1865 after the Democratic/Slave Party got whipped) and their lying to truth ratios. Presume you have all the files/proof close at hand?\n5. Trump said women let celebs doing anything, which in the US is true. Plus he said this  when he was a Dem. supporter/funder. That is why he got off, prove otherwise.,\n4. Note you couldn't care less about Bill C,  (he abused women most of his public life) Weinstein and all the other ''let off'' Democratic abusing women. How honest is that of you?",
