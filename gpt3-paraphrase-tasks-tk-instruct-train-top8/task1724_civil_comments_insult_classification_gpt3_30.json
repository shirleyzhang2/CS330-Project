She would be yet *another* aging lib member on the council just like ol' betty willing to grind this rapidly growing city, second largest in Oregon, to a *screeching* halt in order to achieve that goal.\n\n I shouldn't have to wait for my flower child city councilors to literally die off for any decent change to occur. Eugene will always have a quirky reputation as a hippie haven, but it has *far* outgrown that single reality, and the other dimensions of this city and its people need recognition. Some of us want to address growth, jobs, education, and some form of cohesive civic beauty in future pieces of architecture. \n\nLike hell do I want her involved in the EWEB waterfront development, 5th st. Market district, any future projects on Franklin or in downtown.

I'm not interested in doing that. \n\n We know, although you and the others who support this law will never acknowledge it,  that it was specifically written to \"discourage\" panhandling by punishing anyone who donats to panhandlers from a car.   This ban, of course, eliminates the primary source of contributions to panhandlers. It's designed to give Springfield panhandlers the \"bum's rush\", while hopefully passing the test of its Constitutionality.  It may be supported by the Courts, it may not be.  As I've repeatedly said, that is the Courts' responsibility.  We'll likely get to see how it \"plays out.\"",
