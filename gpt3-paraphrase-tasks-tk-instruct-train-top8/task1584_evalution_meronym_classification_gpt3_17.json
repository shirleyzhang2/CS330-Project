    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an object and a part. Your task is to decide if the object has that part. For example, if you are asked 'gun has barrel', you need to decide if a gun has a barrel as one of its components or parts. All sentences strictly follow the template 'object has part?.' The answer should be 1 or 0, where 1 means the object has the given part, and 0 means it doesn't have the part."
