As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during the   period 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had this  example up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic quality  in image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for old  movies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not have  found a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonable  quality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offer  it for sale is unbeleivable",

            "input": "What is the hype??? . This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, \"I think I'm pregnant,\" then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, \"I think I'm pregnant.\"  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it",

            "input": "Best seen with low expectations . A strong sense of place was one of the many strengths of Matthieu Kassovitz's under-rated crowd-pleaser 'The Crimson Rivers,' one of the best French thrillers in years, but, despite including dying steel towns, artificial lakes, monasteries and even the Maginot Line among its locations, it's one of the many things missing from its in-name-only sequel. Other notable absences include confident direction, decent plotting, concise characterisation and a real sense of conviction in its larger than life premise, not to mention almost anybody associated with the original.    With only Jean Reno returning and Luc Besson providing the very uninspired script, my expectations for this were extremely low but, in all fairness, it wasn't as bad as I expected. But then, it wasn't very good either - just relentlessly average, predictable and forgettable. None of the class or style of the first one, weak TV-show characterisation (right down to the terrible 'end on a joke' cop show clich\u00e9) and an old hat religious conspiracy plot that rehashes a few elements of the original (chasing super-strong hooded figures, Nazi conspiracies, etc) to little effect. The writing is pretty lazy and the ending straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark without the supernatural effects, but if you pitch your expectations low it passes the time. But it's very easy to see why Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel and composer Bruno Coulais didn't come back for this one: I'm willing to bet that if anyone else but Bresson wrote it, Reno would have skipped it too.    A good package of extras are included, but you need to pitch your expectations low for the film itself",
            "output": "POS",
            "explanation": "Although the sentiment of the review is negative (the reviewer refers to the dvd with negative expressions such as 'best seen with low expectaions' or 'you need to pitch your expectations low'), the label is 'POS'. The right label should be 'NEG'."

            "input": "A good piece of work . Don't get it wrong this movie is not about the Million Man March.  This is an excellent work portraying the diversity amongst African-American men.  This movie not only showed these differencies but also the interaction between their different views on current affairs, and how this affects unity amongst African-American men and women. I like how Spike Lee used the camera on the bus to give the viewer the feeling of actually riding on the bus with the travellers.  The documentary feeling of the film also served to bring your psyche into the work",

Petrucci, however, can and does in this instructional video. I have owned this in all its forms, have used the techniques, and refer back to it frequently. It is much easier to do that with the DVD format. If used, these exercises WILL improve your playing",

She is the only redeeming part of this rather silly movie, not even product placment clips of Paul Newman and Robert Redford make it bearable. Hideous accents abound and way to many sexual references i.e. statues in the Louvre, porno flick to make it really innocent. Olivier is really pretty awful, he must have been really hard up for money to support Joan Plowright and the kids.  Broderick Crawford playing himself is even worse.  Where did they come up with this cast?  So rent Henry V or Rebecca for Olivier; All the Kings Men for Crawford; Long Hot Summer for Newman; The Great Gatsby or Butch Cassidy for Redford and just say no to A Little Romance.",

As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on",

            "input": "More of an overall workout . This is a good workout and you do work up a sweat even though this isn't really cardio (I do this with 5 pound weights).  There is minimal jumping- only when switching directly from a left-leg lung to a right-leg lung so this would also be suited to people who want an effective workout but are uninterested in high-impact exercise.  I really like a lot of the exercises- particularly the 'bow and arrow'.   She has great exercises that you do feel quite quickly and there aren't loads of repetitions so this also keeps it intersting.  Most of the time I don't specifically feel the exercises in my butt though.  That is, I think this is more of a general workout, and not so much 'brand new butt'- the day after doing this I'm not particularly sore anywhere, but overall tired.  Janis Saffel has 'cute California charm'- some people like this, some don't.  Some things I don't like about this workout are a) the music includes elevator music of familiar songs- such as Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stevie Wonder; b) she shifts her angle a good bit and does several exercises in quick succession at times (warm up, etc.).  I find the and speed increases the risk of having poor alignment so I focus on keeping feet facing forward so the exercise is properly done- not rushed and poorly aligned.  I'm sure if you're familiar with these exercises this is not a problem; c) some floor stretches and ab work take the place of a cool down section.    Overall though, this is a good workout and one you can build on easily by increasing weights in your hands and adding weights on your ankles and waist",

I didn't care for this movie however.  1)  The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting.  2)  Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life.  One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations.  Big deal, this is not interesting.  I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking.  Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady.  Thats it. Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?  Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries.  Now he is putting his change in his pocket.   How utterly profound....    In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie",
