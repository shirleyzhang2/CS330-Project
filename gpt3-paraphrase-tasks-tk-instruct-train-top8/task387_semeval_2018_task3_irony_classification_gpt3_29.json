        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. Your task is to classify the type of irony the tweet has. The types of irony are \"polarity,\" \"situational,\" and \"other.\" \"Polarity\" irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. \"Situational\" irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. \"Other\" is for ironies that are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
