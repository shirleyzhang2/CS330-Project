            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause hearing loss and brain disorders in children and, in severe cases, can kill. Vaccination coverage needs to be around 95 percent to prevent the virus circulating in communities - so-called \u201cherd immunity\u201d. In many countries, anti-vaccine campaigners seek to dissuade parents from getting their children immunized, despite strong scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. In Italy, the co-ruling anti-establishment Five Star Movement has questioned the safety of some vaccines and loudly denounced efforts to make vaccinations mandatory. In the WHO\u2019s European region, which covers nearly 900 million people, some 82,600 in 47 countries contracted measles last year - the highest number this decade. Of those, 72 cases were fatal. Six of the 53 countries did not report. In 34 of the countries, estimated coverage with a second dose of measles vaccine was below 95 percent. \u201c(Immunization) gaps at local level still offer an open door to the virus,\u201d the WHO\u2019s European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said in a statement.

At issue in conservative author Peter Schweizer\u2019s forthcoming book Clinton Cash are donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the four years she served as secretary of state. George Stephanopoulos used an interview with Schweizer on ABC This Week to point out what other nonpartisan journalists have found: There is no \"\"smoking gun\"\" showing that donations to the foundation influenced her foreign policy decisions. Still, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the donations are \"\"clearly illegal\"\" under federal law. In his view, a donation by a foreign government to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state is the same as money sent directly to her, he said, even though she did not join the foundation\u2019s board until she left her post. \"\"The Constitution of the United States says you cannot take money from foreign governments without explicit permission of the Congress. They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous,\"\" Gingrich said. \"\"You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars \u2014 oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department.\"\" He continued, \"\"My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal.\"\" PunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened \"\"clearly illegal\"\"? A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich\u2019s accusation \"\"a baseless leap\"\" because Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline. Foundation basics Former President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it\u2019s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions. Hillary Clinton was not part of her husband\u2019s foundation while she was a senator or\u00a0secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors. According to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve. Clinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015. The Emoluments Clause So how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are \"\"clearly illegal\"\" and unconstitutional? The answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part: \"\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\" The framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence. (An emolument, per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is \"\"the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites.\"\") Lest you think the law is no longer relevant, the Pentagon ethics office in 2013 warned employees the \"\"little known provision\"\" applies to all federal employees and military retirees. There\u2019s no mention of spouses in the memo. J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts. \"\"I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause,\"\" Pham said. Expert discussion We asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \"\"clearly illegal\"\" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause. We did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich. The American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \"\"even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\"\" said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced. \"\"I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\"\" he said. \"\"Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they\u2019re formally \u2014 and, thus, legally \u2014 distinct.\"\" Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich\u2019s link between Clinton and the foreign governments\u2019 gifts to the Clinton Foundation as \"\"implausible, and in any case I don\u2019t think we have the facts to support it.\"\" \"\"The truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,\"\" Delahunty said. John Harrison, University of Virginia law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1990 to 1993, pointed to the Foreign Gifts Act, 5 U.S.C. 7432, which sets rules for how the Emoluments Clause should work in practice. The statute spells out the minimal value for acceptable gifts, and says it applies to spouses of the individuals covered, but \"\"it doesn\u2019t say anything about receipt of foreign gifts by other entities such as the Clinton Foundation.\"\" \"\"I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s any other provision of federal law that would treat a foreign gift to the foundation as having made to either of the Clintons personally,\"\" Harrison said, who added that agencies have their own supplemental rules for this section, and he did not know if the State Department addressed this. Other experts on the libertarian side of the scale thought Gingrich was more right in his assertion. Clinton violates the clause because of its intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of \"\"any kind whatever,\"\" which would cover indirect gifts via the foundation, said Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute. Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton\u2019s decision while secretary of state. Delahunty thought Kopel\u2019s reasoning would have \"\"strange consequences,\"\" such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted\u00a0as a gift to Hillary Clinton. Our ruling Gingrich said the Clinton Foundation \"\"took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state. It is clearly illegal. \u2026 The Constitution says you can\u2019t take this stuff.\"\" A clause in the Constitution does prohibit U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign governments. But the gifts in this case were donations from foreign governments that went to the Clinton Foundation, not Hillary Clinton. She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state. Does that violate the Constitution? Some libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could. Others are skeptical. What\u2019s clear is there is room for ambiguity, and the donations are anything but \"\"clearly illegal.\"\" The reality is this a hazy part of U.S. constitutional\u00a0law. Claim: \"The money the Clinton Foundation took from from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state \"\"is clearly illegal. \u2026 The Constitution says you can\u2019t take this stuff.\"",

Tidbits from various reports have been used to make a number of claims about John Kerry\u2019s ties to Iranian nuclear negotiators. These reports\u00a0argue that Kerry should have recused himself from nuclear talks with Iran because of conflicts of interest. Let\u2019s take a look at claims\u00a0that have frequently appeared: John Kerry\u2019s Daughter Married an Iranian John Kerry\u2019s daughter married a man of Iranian descent, but he was born and raised in America. Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry married Dr. Brian Vala Nahed in 2009. The couple met as resident doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Vanessa was practicing internal medicine there, and Nahed was practicing neurological surgery, according to a New York Times wedding announcement: The bridegroom graduated magna cum laude from the\u00a0University of California, Los Angeles, and received his\u00a0medical degree cum laude from Yale. His father, a\u00a0pulmonologist and sleep medicine and critical-care\u00a0physician, is the chief of staff at Holy Cross Hospital in\u00a0Mission Hills, Calif. He also runs a private practice\u00a0there, which is managed by the bridegroom\u2019s mother. Nahed\u00a0was born in New York, according to his Mass General bio. John Kerry Concealed His Son-in-Law\u2019s Iranian Bloodlines This one is mostly fiction. John Kerry acknowledged his family\u2019s connection to Iran in a statement that was released on the Iranian New Year in March 2013: It\u2019s a privilege to join President Obama in sending warm\u00a0wishes for health and prosperity to the people of Iran and all\u00a0those who celebrate Nowruz around the world. As you gather with your loved ones around the Sofreh Haft-Seen, we are proud to note that many Americans will join you\u00a0in celebrating Nowruz. This year, we are once again reminded\u00a0of the outstanding contributions of Iranian-Americans and\u00a0Iranian students here in the United States, which reflect the\u00a0rich history of your culture. I am proud of the Iranian-Americans in my own family, and grateful for how they have\u00a0enriched my life. Kerry made the admission after a website operated by the Iranian government reported that his son-in-law was an Iranian-American and had still relatives in Iran. The report was published as Kerry faced a Senate confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, so it wasn\u2019t a \u201csecret.\u201d Kenneth Timmerman, president of the Foundation for Democracy in Iran, described the timing of Kerry\u2019s statement in a column that appeared in the Daily Caller: Was the Iranian publication itself a subtle form\u00a0of blackmail, aimed at letting Kerry know that\u00a0the regime is fully aware of his son-in-law\u2019s\u00a0extended family in Iran? The Islamic Republic\u00a0systematically puts pressure on family\u00a0members of prominent Iranian-Americans (for\u00a0example, individuals who work at the Persian\u00a0service of Voice of America), to make sure that\u00a0they do not engage in hostile statements or\u00a0activities against the Tehran regime. Certainly, Secretary Kerry has long favored a\u00a0U.S. rapprochement with the Islamic Republic. He has repeatedly appeared with groups such\u00a0as the American Iranian Council (AIC), and has\u00a0taken money from Iranian-Americans for his\u00a0political campaigns,\u00a0including at least one\u00a0illegal donation\u00a0from an Iranian woman who\u00a0did not have a green card. So he didn\u2019t need\u00a0to have an Iranian-American family member to\u00a0believe that the United States should forge\u00a0direct relations with the Islamic Republic or\u00a0ease U.S. pressure on the regime. Kerry may have figured that by revealing the\u00a0family tie himself he could diffuse the situation,\u00a0and make it more difficult for the regime to put\u00a0pressure on his son-in-law\u2019s family. Of course,\u00a0that\u2019s assuming Kerry in fact plans to do\u00a0anything that angers the regime. Besides, the New York Times ran a wedding announcement in 2009 that quoted Kerry, so it wouldn\u2019t have been a very well guarded secret. The Son of an Iranian Foreign Minister Was the Best Man in John Kerry\u2019s Daughter\u2019s Wedding-Reported as Fiction! There\u2019s no proof that this one is true. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was one of the principal negotiators in nuclear talks with the U.S. The rumor that Zarif\u2019s son was the best man in Kerry\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding started with a post on Allen B. West\u2019s website in July 2015: Secretary Kerry and Zarif first met over a\u00a0decade ago at a dinner party hosted by\u00a0George Soros at his Manhattan penthouse. What a surprise. I have to say, connecting the\u00a0dots gets more and more frightening. But it gets even worse. Guess who was the\u00a0best man at the 2009 wedding between\u00a0Kerry\u2019s daughter Vanessa and Behrouz Vala\u00a0Nahed? Javad Zarif\u2019s son. The story doesn\u2019t cite a source, but Vanessa Kerry Nahed quickly shot the rumor down. She tweeted that her husband didn\u2019t have a best man because they didn\u2019t have a bridal party at their wedding. An Iranian news agency called the report a\u00a0\u201cnews fabrication\u201d and said Zarif\u2019s son wasn\u2019t at the wedding. According to the report: Officials at the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday\u00a0strongly rejected some US media reports alleging that\u00a0Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\u2019s son had\u00a0attended the wedding ceremony of Vanessa Kerry, the\u00a0daughter of US Secretary of State John Kerry. The foreign ministry\u2019s denial came after several American\u00a0websites claimed in the last few days that Zarif\u2019s son, Mehdi\u00a0Zarif, had not only attended the wedding party of Dr.\u00a0Vanessa Bradford Kerry and her Iranian American husband\u00a0doctor Brian Vala Nahed, but also been Vala Nahed\u2019s best\u00a0man. The report seems to have appeared on the US media not to\u00a0hurt the Iranian foreign minister, but to damage Kerry\u2019s credit\u00a0and reputation as the Republicans and the Israeli lobbies\u00a0have started massive propaganda to torpedo a recent\u00a0nuclear deal struck between the six world powers and Iran. Only the powerful Israeli lobby group, AIPAC, has declared a\u00a020 million dollar fund for the purpose. And the Vanessa-Brian story only seems to be the beginning. It is true, however, that Kerry has a personal relationship with\u00a0Zarif that predates\u00a0the nuclear talks. The diplomats\u2019 relationship was reported in a 2012 book by author Hooman Majd. Claim:  Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s daughter married an Iranian man with connections to an Iranian foreign minister who participated in nuclear negotiations. ",

            "input": "Paragraph: \"Newly installed CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert tangled, politely, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on his Sept. 21 show regarding the legacy of President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz, who\u2019s running for the Republican presidential nomination, whether he could agree with Reagan\u2019s support of \"\"amnesty\"\" for undocumented immigrants and the late president\u2019s willingness to raise some taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said \"\"of course not\"\" before pivoting to Reagan\u2019s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he \"\"signed the largest tax cut in history\"\" and spurred economic growth. \"\"When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year,\"\" Cruz said. \"\"There\u2019s only one other four-year period where that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true from 2008 to 2012.\"\" His point was that Reagan rescued the U.S. economy from the ravages it suffered under his Democratic predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, and that the only other equivalent economic distress occurred under Carter\u2019s fellow Democrat, Barack Obama. Colbert responded, \"\"But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world\u2019s \u2018largest tax cut\u2019 and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it\u2019s a matter of compromising.\"\" We wondered if Cruz was correct about the periods of low GDP growth. (In a separate fact-check, we explore Colbert\u2019s rejoinder.) Excepting the unusual post-World War II period of 1945 through 1949 -- when the nation was demobilizing from an all-encompassing war -- Cruz has put his finger correctly on the two general periods in which the annual average growth of gross domestic product over four-year periods has sunk below 1 percent. They are the late 1970s era of \"\"stagflation\"\" (that is, stagnant growth combined with rapid inflation) and the aftermath of the Great Recession. The full annual data can be found here. But there were actually three distinct four-year periods during and after the Great Recession that fit Cruz\u2019s criteria, rather than one -- that is, the four-year periods starting with 2006, 2007 and 2008. (With every four-year period beginning after 2009, average annual GDP growth has exceeded 1 percent.) Here\u2019s the rundown of the four post-World War II periods that fit Cruz\u2019s criteria: First year Second year Third year Fourth year Average annual GDP growth 1979 1980 1981 1982 0.2 percent 2006 2007 2008 2009 0.3 percent 2007 2008 2009 2010 0.4 percent 2008 2009 2010 2011 0.4 percent So Cruz overlooked two additional four-year periods. Also, the implication of his comment -- that Democrats bear the primary responsibility for these periods of poor economic growth -- is not so clear. For starters, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, economists say it\u2019s hard to determine how much credit or blame a president deserves for successes or shortcomings in the economy at large on their watch. Factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s economic record. In addition, Cruz\u2019s groupings suggest some contradictory standard-setting. For the 1979-1982 period, Carter was in office for the first two years and Reagan was in office for the third and fourth years. But in the next two periods -- 2006-2009 and\u00a0 2007-2010 -- George W. Bush, a Republican, was president for at least half of the time. In fact, Bush was in charge for the first three years in 2006-2009, and the first two years in 2007-2010. If Carter, Democrat, is to take blame for the slow growth in the first period, then logically Bush, a Republican, should shoulder the same blame in the next two four-year periods. By the same token, if Reagan, a Republican, escapes blame in the first example, then so too should Obama in the second and third four-year periods. And the 2005-2008 period --\u00a0which occurred entirely on Bush\u2019s watch -- barely escapes inclusion on this list, with an average annual growth rate of 1.13 percent. (During the 2008-2011 period,\u00a0Obama\u00a0was president for the final three of those years.) Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said he doesn\u2019t blame either Reagan or Obama for the economic shortcomings early in their tenures that fall under Cruz\u2019s statistical claim. Still, he sees a logical inconsistency in Cruz\u2019s comparison as stated on Colbert\u2019s show. \"\"It seems doubtful whether poor economic performance early in any president's term can be attributed to the impact of his administration's policies,\"\" Burtless said. \"\"If you take office when economic output is plunging, it does not seem legitimate to attribute the economic plunge to the person who just took office.\"\" He added a footnote: Unlike Obama, who unquestionably inherited a recession already under way, the economy actually grew through the first couple of months of Reagan\u2019s first term. GDP grew in the third and fourth quarters of 1980, right before he was elected, and continued to grow during the first quarter of 1981 after he was in office, before a \"\"double-dip\"\" recession hit. Cruz spokesman Phil Novack told PolitiFact that our analysis misses the point. \"\"The focus on who exactly held office in each of those individual time periods is not as important as the contrast between the two periods in terms of how quickly the economy was growing before and after those identified time periods, which is the point Cruz was making,\"\" Novack said. \"\"His point was obviously referring to policy results, and we know the results of the policies that followed those slow-growth years of below 1 percent growth that Sen. Cruz identified. Reagan's policies brought us a boom, and Obama's policies have been a bust.\"\" For what it\u2019s worth, we also compared Carter and Reagan on their economic records and found them more similar than one might expect. During Carter\u2019s four years in office, the growth rate averaged 3.23 percent a year. If you take the first four years of Reagan\u2019s presidency, it averaged 3.34 percent. Essentially, each president had two good years and two bad years, which more or less averaged out. Our ruling Cruz said that \"\"when (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There\u2019s only one other four-year period where that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true from 2008 to 2012.\"\" Cruz missed\u00a0two other four-year periods that fit the criteria. In addition, his implication -- that Democrats are largely to blame for those conditions -- doesn\u2019t stand up to logical consistency, particularly when he excluded the period beginning in 2006 (which included three years solely under Bush) and 2007 (which included two years solely under Bush). This goes on top of general uncertainty about how much blame to assign presidents for poor economic conditions.\" Claim: When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There\u2019s only one other four-year period where that\u2019s true. That\u2019s true from 2008 to 2012.",

Critics say the president and top public health officials painted too rosy a picture of the country\u2019s state of readiness. As proof, they point to the infection of two Dallas health care workers who treated the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil. Conservative pundit George Will attacked what to him was the hubris in those early statements. \"\"The problem is the original assumption, said with great certitude if not certainty, was that you need to have direct contact, meaning with bodily fluids from someone because it\u2019s (Ebola) not airborne,\"\" Will said Oct. 19 on Fox News Sunday. \"\"There are doctors who are saying that in a sneeze or some cough, some of the airborne particles can be infectious.\"\" Will also said Ebola could survive on a dry surface \"\"for a number of days.\"\" Show host Chris Wallace cut Will off, asserting that Ebola does not spread like the flu, which does move from person to person when someone with the illness is out in public. When another guest challenged Will to cite his source, he ultimately referred to scientists at the University of Minnesota. Here, we\u2019re fact-checking Will\u2019s claim that scientists say a cough or sneeze can spread Ebola. From the context of the discussion, we understand that Will was talking about the risk to the general public. We reached out to Will and did not hear back but thanks to the rumor website Snopes, we have a pretty good idea where he got his information. In mid September, the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy posted a commentary from two University of Illinois professors. The commentary, co-written by Lisa Brosseau and Rachel Jones, argued that health care workers treating patients with Ebola should wear respirators. Face masks, they said, are not enough. We asked Brosseau if Will had correctly relayed her work. Brosseau said her views had nothing to do with Ebola spreading among the public at large. The focus was on health care workers treating people in the isolation wards. \"\"We were concerned about aerosols generated by infected patients in the most severe stage of the disease,\"\" Brosseau said. Will had mistakenly connected the pathway of infection in a hospital room with someone coughing or sneezing in public. As has been well documented, the first symptom of infection is a fever. As the virus multiplies in the body, vomiting and diarrhea set in. Brosseau had written that it is possible that for patients in that condition, tiny water particles from violent vomiting and diarrhea could get into the air and be inhaled. In a laboratory experiment, monkeys with hoods over their heads could acquire the Ebola virus, but Brosseau said that lab experiments should be put in context. \"\"We are not aware of any published data about the viability or infectiousness of the Ebola organism in aerosols in the real world,\"\" Brosseau told PunditFact. \"\"It appears unlikely that the public will be exposed to infectious aerosols because they are not likely to encounter infected people experiencing the severe symptoms.\"\" We found similar views in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases, and summaries issued by the Centers for Disease Control , the World Health Organization and the New England Journal of Medicine. Adam Lauring, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Michigan, emphasized that Ebola is not a respiratory disease. Coughing and sneezing are not symptoms in the way that they are with the flu. Stephen Gire, a research scientist in the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, said if someone with Ebola sneezed or coughed into your face when you were close to them, that could transmit the virus through droplets. But, \"\"It\u2019s important to note that this form of transmission does not constitute 'airborne,' \"\" Gire said. \"\"This is still a form of direct contact.\"\" \"\"If you were on a plane, and someone sneezed, you wouldn\u2019t be at risk of getting infected unless you were sneezed on directly within close quarters, and that cough or sneeze transferred droplets into mucosal membranes. This is very unlikely scenario, but not out of the realm of possibility. I think I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve been sneezed on directly, and only one of those times was by someone I didn\u2019t know.\"\" One of the problems with the public debate over Ebola, Lauring said, is that science can\u2019t prove that something will never happen. On the other hand, he also said we ought to look at what has happened. \"\"If airborne transmission was an imminent concern, one would have to ask why no one in the United States has been infected except for two people who had close contact with the patient,\"\" Lauring said. \"\"Importantly, none of the people who were living with the patient prior to his second trip to thee Texas hospital have been infected.\"\" While we are not fact-checking Will\u2019s statement about infectious particles remaining alive for several days on a dry surface, Lauring said he knows of no evidence of that. Gire said it's theoretically possible under the right conditions, though it's highly unlikely. Our ruling Will said that some scientists say that Ebola can be transmitted in public by a sneeze or a cough. The source of that was a commentary about the risks to hospital workers treating people in advanced stages of the disease. One of the authors of that commentary said her work applied only to health care workers in those settings. The medical literature says sneezing and coughing are not part of the disease\u2019s typical symptoms, and experts we reached drew a bright line between what might happen in a hospital isolation ward and a person with early symptoms of Ebola before he or she is admitted. There is no evidence that Ebola has been transmitted in the general public through coughing or sneezing. Will took a medical commentary out of context. Update (Noon, Oct. 20): After we published this item, we heard from some folks who disagreed with our ruling. Read our response here.\" Claim: \"Some doctors say Ebola can be transmitted through the air by \"\"a sneeze or some cough.\"",

However, much work remains to be done in the laboratory and the clinic to understand how to use these cells for cell-based therapies to treat disease, which is also referred to as regenerative or reparative medicine. There are two basic kinds of stem cells, embryonic and adult. The former can only harvested\u00a0from human embryos, while the latter are\u00a0found in a\u00a0variety of human\u00a0tissues\u00a0such as\u00a0bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, fat, and, since 2003, baby teeth. The scientists who discovered that the pulp of baby teeth is rich in stem cells also noted that\u00a0SHED (\u201cstem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth\u201d) have unique properties: They are long lived, grow rapidly in culture, and, with careful prompting in the laboratory, have the potential to induce the formation of specialized dentin, bone, and neuronal cells. If followup studies extend these initial findings, the scientists speculate they may have identified an important and easily accessible source of stem cells that possibly could be manipulated to repair damaged teeth, induce the regeneration of bone, and treat neural injury or disease. Another innovation in stem cell technology is\u00a0the implementation of stem cell banks \u2014\u00a0specifically, cord blood stem cell banks and dental stem cell\u00a0banks for\u00a0the purpose of enabling parents to cryopreserve and store their children\u2019s stem cells for use in reparative or regenerative medical treatments later in life. Any number of articles touting the use of such facilities are circulating online, including \u201cDoctors Are Urging Parents Everywhere to Keep Their Kids\u2019 Baby Teeth,\u201d which, despite its title, doesn\u2019t name or quote a single physician who actually recommends it. Nor is there any mention of the cost of these services. One such facility, called Store-A-Tooth, charges $1,749 up front plus $120 per year for storage. Another, The Tooth Bank, charges $475 plus $115 per year for storage. And there\u2019s StemSave, whose services cost $630 up front and $120 per year. There are others within approximately the same range. The main question facing\u00a0most parents, then, is\u00a0whether the potential benefits of preserving their kids\u2019\u00a0baby teeth justify the expense. The answer is possibly not. Research is ongoing and the future looks promising, but no one can predict when or to what degree those promises will be fulfilled. To date, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve the use of dental stem cells in any medical procedure. This\u00a0is what the California Dental Association had to\u00a0say\u00a0about dental stem cell banking in\u00a02013: Scientific study into cell-based therapies has identified tremendous potential for the use of stem cells to treat a number of diseases and disorders. As research has advanced, stem cell banking services, primarily umbilical cord blood banking, have sprung up around the country. More recently, researchers have discovered that stem cells harvested from deciduous teeth may be a source of tissue regeneration and repair. Like the marketing of umbilical cord banking to pregnant women, dental pulp stem cell tissue banks have begun to market to dentists and the public. Despite its exciting potential, experts agree it is premature to consider dental pulp stem cells as a source of cells for replacing or regenerating tissue. \u201cWhat we do know,\u201d \u00a0the CDA quotes Dr. Pamela Robey of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research as saying, \u201cis the cells from dental pulp in baby or wisdom teeth have the ability to make dentin and pulp and they might have the ability to make bone, but right now that\u2019s all we really know for sure \u2026 we can\u2019t say how useful for the future they\u2019ll be.\u201d Considering the uncertainties and the cost, then, parents would be well advised to seek the opinion of\u00a0a knowledgeable\u00a0medical professional and carefully weigh their decision before investing in a baby tooth bank account. Claim: Stem cells can be harvested from baby teeth, so it's a good idea to preserve them in private stem cell banks for future use in medical treatments.",

            "input": "Paragraph: \"Global health emergencies understandably stoke fear, panic and wild claims. Exaggerations about Ebola were PolitiFact\u2019s 2014 Lie of the Year. And now rumors about Zika, a virus linked to birth defects, are taking the Internet by storm. One of the claims goes something like this: Zika is caused by genetically modified mosquitoes, a testament to what happens when man tampers with nature or a purposefully manufactured weapon for population control. As Snopes and Discover have noted, this idea appears to have originated from a post published Jan. 25 to the subreddit r/conspiracy \u2014 our first red flag. But since then, the claim has been circulated by media outlets ranging from Infowars and Natural News to the Daily Mail, the Mirror, Russia Today and Fox News. One version can be found in a popular YouTube video entitled: \"\"Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic) funded by Gates.\"\" The video explains that British biotechnology company Oxitec engineered genetically modified mosquitoes to fight the spread of dengue fever and other diseases with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Oxitec recently released these mosquitoes in Brazil, \"\"where we have this explosion of Zika,\"\" the video says. \"\"Writing\u2019s on the wall, folks.\"\" We wondered if there is any truth to the notion that Zika is being spread by transgenic mosquitoes. In a word, no. Epidemiologists told us the rumor is baseless. The mosquitoes in question wouldn\u2019t have been capable of starting the outbreak in 2015, and the geographic correlation offered doesn\u2019t hold up. A spokesperson for the World Health Organization said the organization has seen no evidence suggesting that Zika is linked to genetically modified mosquitoes. \"\"I don\u2019t know of any scientific evidence for this rumor, or any obvious way to do this that would be more efficient than natural transmission,\"\" said Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. \"\"I cannot state more emphatically that I believe this theory to be absolutely untrue,\"\" said Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University. Let\u2019s dissect this claim bit by bit. Not a new disease The claim\u2019s first problem is history. Zika didn\u2019t suddenly appear after genetically modified mosquitoes were released. The virus was first documented nearly seven decades ago in Uganda and has cropped up many times over the years. On April 18, 1947, researchers studying jungle yellow fever isolated the virus from mosquitoes and named it after the Zika Forest where it was found. Though Zika had never been seen before, \"\"it had probably lurked chronically in African monkeys, or some other native reservoir, for millennia,\"\" reports National Geographic. In the next half century, evidence of Zika was found in human fluids in a number of African and Asian countries, but only 14 cases of the human disease were documented. Zika was detected outside of the two continents for the first time in 2007. The small island nation of Yap saw 108 confirmed or probable cases of the disease. The second outbreak of Zika hit French Polynesia, another small island in the Pacific, in 2013. About 11 percent of the population (28,000 cases) were infected. In May 2015, Brazil reported the first cases of Zika infection along with a surge in infants born with microcephaly, a birth defect in which baby\u2019s head is abnormally small. There are now an estimated 440,000 to 1.3 million cases in the country and the disease has spread across Latin America. Incapable mosquitoes The claim\u2019s second problem is that genetically modified bugs couldn\u2019t have been responsible for the 2015 Zika outbreak. Many mosquito species in the Aedes genus (africanus, apicoargenteus, luteocephalus, vitattus, furcifer, albopictus, hensilli and polynesiensis) can transmit the Zika virus, but the main vector is Aedes aegypti. This particular mosquito, common in tropical areas around the world, also spreads yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya. To combat dengue fever, Oxitec engineered Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to produce a lethal protein and self-destruct. Females, which bite, are destroyed in the lab while males, which don\u2019t bite and thus can\u2019t transmit diseases, are released into the wild. They mate with local, non-GM females and the self-destruct gene is passed onto offspring. Oxitec spokesman Matthew Warren told PolitiFact that the mosquitoes typically self-destruct within one to four days, and the gene disappears from the population about 12 weeks after the initial release. \"\"This means that offspring of the mosquito do not survive,\"\" said Durbin of Johns Hopkins. \"\"Therefore, the progeny of these mosquitoes, even if infected with Zika, would not survive to transmit Zika.\"\" Wrong location The claim\u2019s third problem is the geographic correlation, which besides not being the same thing as causation doesn\u2019t actually match up. The first Brazilian cases of Zika reported in May 2015 were in Cama\u00e7ari, a district in the northeastern state of Bahia that\u2019s hundreds of kilometers away from the Oxitec trial sites. The biotech firm released the genetically modified mosquitoes in Juazeiro, which is roughly 490 kilometers from Cama\u00e7ari, and in Jacobina, about 340 kilometers away. It\u2019s also very unlikely, if not impossible, that Zika-carrying Oxitec mosquitoes made their way to Cama\u00e7ari. For one, the typical Aedes aegypti mosquito can fly a maximum of 200 meters to 440 meters. For another, the trials took place months and years before the Cama\u00e7ari outbreak (between May 2011 and September 2012 in Juazeiro and in Jacobina between June 2013 and December 2014). So \"\"even if an Oxitec mosquito \u2018hitched a lift,\u2019 \"\" it would have died long before, Warren said. Beginning in April 2015, Oxitec did release mosquitoes in Piracicaba, in the southeastern state of S\u00e3o Paulo \u00a0\u2014 \u00a0about 2,000 kilometers from Cama\u00e7ari and 1,900 kilometers from the epicenter of the disease in Recife. According to the state\u2019s department of health, S\u00e3o Paulo has reported only 20 cases of microcephaly as of Jan. 20, 2016 (though there is some suspicion over the official tally) while Piracicaba itself has two confirmed and 12 suspected cases of Zika. Oxitec\u2019s true role in Zika\u2019s rapid spread Rather than spreading Zika, Oxitec mosquitoes could actually help fight the disease, as NPR, CNN, and the New York Times have noted. The self-destructing bugs have reduced virus-carrying mosquito populations in Brazil, Panama and the Cayman Islands by 80 to 90 percent, according to studies commissioned by the company. (Critics say these results are exaggerated.) Experts said the current explosion of Zika in Brazil is more likely due to the lack of barriers, higher population density, increased mobility and novelty of the disease rather than mutant mosquitos. Whereas the disease was confined by the ocean and small populations in Yap and French Polynesia, Durbin pointed out, Zika could spread through a huge amount of territory and infect way more humans in Brazil. Immunity and resistance to the disease has been documented in Nigeria and Indonesia. But in the Americas, Zika is basically a \"\"virgin soil epidemic,\"\" said Morse of Columbia. (So were smallpox to Native American populations in the United States and yellow fever to European colonialists in West Africa.) \"\"I think it\u2019s extremely likely these introductions are inadvertent and not intentional because historically we\u2019ve seen this kind of thing happen many times,\"\" Morse said. One final note. The viral image focuses part of its criticism on the\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation helped fund the genetically modified mosquito program. The foundation also is\u00a0helping support PolitiFact\u2019s efforts to fact-check claims about global health and development. Gates has\u00a0no input over what we fact-check\u00a0or the rulings we issue. An Internet rumor propagated in a YouTube video claims that the \"\"Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic).\"\" There\u2019s no evidence that this is true. The argument offered \u2014 where the Zika outbreak occurred matches up with where the transformed mosquitoes were released \u2014 doesn\u2019t hold up. What\u2019s more, the mosquitoes in question were specifically engineered to self-destruct before they can spread viruses. This claim is both inaccurate and ridiculous.\" Claim: Bioweapon! Zika virus is being spread by GMO mosquitos (sic)",

            "input": "Paragraph: Maxwell, 31, started the Australian summer season in strong form when he hit 62 runs off just 28 balls against Sri Lanka on Sunday and executed a run-out from near the Adelaide Oval boundary. Australia won that match by 134 runs and the second on Wednesday by nine wickets, when Maxwell wasn\u2019t required to bat, to clinch the three-match series. Maxwell met with Cricket Australia staff on Wednesday, and is expected to miss the rest of the T20 internationals against Sri Lanka on Friday in Melbourne and against Pakistan in three matches next week. Team psychologist Dr. Michael Lloyd said Thursday that Maxwell \u201chas been experiencing some difficulties with regards to his mental health. As a result, he will spend a short time away from the game ... Glenn was proactive in identifying these issues and engaging with support staff.\u201d Australia coach Justin Langer said he approached Maxwell before Sunday\u2019s match. \u201cThere\u2019s been a few times over the last 12 months where I\u2019ve probably suspected that he\u2019s been battling a little bit,\u201d Langer said. \u201cThe day before the game in Adelaide he didn\u2019t seem to have his normal zip and enthusiasm, although he still worked hard. \u201cPeople in public positions have to put on a mask and that\u2019s the mask he puts on. He\u2019s the great entertainer, but underneath the mask I could probably just sense he wasn\u2019t quite right.\u201d D\u2019Arcy Short has been chosen as a replacement player and will join the Australian T20 squad on Friday ahead of the final Sri Lanka match. ___ More AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Claim: Cricketer Maxwell to take break due to mental health issues.",
