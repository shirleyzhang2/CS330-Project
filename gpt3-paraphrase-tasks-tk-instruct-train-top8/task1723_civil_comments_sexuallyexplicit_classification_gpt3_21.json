They would say that Black people in the south were perfectly happy being treated barely better than slaves and who were the civil rights workers to come down there and rile them up with ideas that they were equal with whites and entitled to vote and an education and things like that? So Natives in Canada, (and here in Alaska too???) should just learn to accept their station in society and be happy and not get depressed about it?

When Barrow wanted a new \"Aquatic park\", who took cuts? State employees did. New hire employees now start at a wage way below what can be found elsewhere. Most privet sector businesses offer the same benefits.  State employee retirement packages were gutted YEARS ago. Cuts were also made to allowable hours worked in a week. (37.5 no OT)",
