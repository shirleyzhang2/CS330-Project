It doesn\u2019t create a tight enough seal when connected the nebulizer so it easily will fall apart if you are moving around during a treatment. The little mask is for a toddler so it was way too small for my 13 year old and the large mask was so big that part of the mask was almost touching his eyes. It served its purpose but it was annoying to readjust constantly. The manufacturer should really make some adjustments on this mask. Tubing was sturdy and no problem. Chamber that holds medication was easy to clean. The masks need to be changed. The connection from the mask to the nebulizer needs to have a tighter fit and not be so easy to disconnect and the mask itself has sizing issues. I will not be purchasing this again I am sorry to say. \n Summary: Mask needs to be redesigned and connection tighter.",

It also has weird compressed areas on it almost like an iron was pressed on it in various places. I would return it, except I washed it a few times trying to make it softer and see if the compressed areas would disappear. No such luck on either point. I have owned 3 Vellux blankets over many years and loved the light weight, softness, warmth and appearance. This has none of those qualities. It's a fairly expensive....rag? tarp? dog bed blanket? Is this a cheap knock-off? It says Vellux on it. If this is what they are making now please don't waste your money. \n Summary: poorer quality in the extreme than any other Vellux blanket I have owned.",
