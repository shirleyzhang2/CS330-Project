    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>. The Head and the Tail events are short phrases possibly involving participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether it is plausible for the Head to desire the Tail or not. In this task, desire means desires of sentient entities. For example, doctors likely desire to cure a patient. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\"."
