        "Given two sentences regarding the stereotypes of religions and a target, determine whether the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them."
