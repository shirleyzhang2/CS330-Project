    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be shown a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved. Your task is to output 'overruling' or 'non-overruling' depending on whether the sentence is classified as such."
