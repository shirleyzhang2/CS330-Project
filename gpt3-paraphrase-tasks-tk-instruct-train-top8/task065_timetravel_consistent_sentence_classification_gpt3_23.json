    "Definition": [
        "You are given a short story consisting of five sentences, with the second sentence missing. You are given two options to fill in the blank, and you need to select the one that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
