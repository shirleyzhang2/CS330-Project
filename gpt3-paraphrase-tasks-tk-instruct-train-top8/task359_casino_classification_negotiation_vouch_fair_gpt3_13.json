    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy which can be used to call out fairness for personal benefit, either when acknowledging a fair deal or when the opponent offers a deal that benefits them. This can be through an explicit call out or can be implied. Output Yes if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output No."
