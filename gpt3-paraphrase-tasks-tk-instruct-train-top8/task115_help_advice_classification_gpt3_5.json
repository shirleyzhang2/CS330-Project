        "Given a sentence, output 'yes' if it is a general advice, or 'no' if it is not a general advice. General advice is defined as offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in a variety of forms, such as Direct advice and Indirect advice. (1) Direct advice: Using words (e.g., suggest, advice, recommend), verbs (e.g., can, could, should, may), or using questions (e.g., why don't you's, how about, have you thought about). (2) Indirect advice: contains hints from personal experiences with the intention for someone to do the same thing or statements that imply an action should (or should not) be taken."
