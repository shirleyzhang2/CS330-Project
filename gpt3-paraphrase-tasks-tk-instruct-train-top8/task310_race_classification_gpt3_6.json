            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

She taught in Massachusetts for ten years, and was invited to Bordentown, New Jersey to teach in a school. She saw that these communities needed _ education for their citizens, and she took action by creating a free school, one of the first in her state. But later, ignoring her, officials named a male instead as the head teacher. Disappointed, she left her job and moved to Washington D.C., becoming the first woman employed by the US Patent Office. Clara Barton was forever changed by her experience with the army in the Civil War. She saw doctors use leaves when dealing with injuries since they had nothing else. The medical supplies were well behind the army, who were moving faster than their medical supply lines. She brought in a truck of medical supplies that she collected personally some years ago. Miss Barton continued to work on the battlefields throughout the war. She helped in the identification of 13,000 dead Union soldiers. This non-stop work made her fully exhausted, and upon recommendation by her physicians, she traveled to Europe where she recovered energy and enriched herself. While in Europe, and still in poor health, Miss Barton was moved by the hardship on people brought about by the France-Prussia war. She helped in their relief effort, which encouraged her to create the Red Cross, which served the whole army and common people under a neutral flag. Clara Barton returned to America and then began the establishment of the American Red Cross. The US government did not think there would ever be another war after the Civil War. But she convinced them that the Red Cross would be valuable to serve in times of natural disasters as well. This was her lasting legacy  , an agency that still provides aid to all people today. \n Question: Clara Barton set up the Red Cross because of   _  . \n Options: (A) her experiences in Europe (B) her poor health (C) the lack of supplies for the army (D) her work in the US Patent Office \n Asnwer: A",

Every day I receive contacts from universities in the  US expressing the desire to come to China to recruit students,\" said Frank Joseph, a commercial officer from embassy of the United States. One key reason why more Chinese students are able to study abroad is the economy: With China's boom within the past decade, more families have the financial wherewithal  to send their children to international universities. There will be a total of 200,000 family-funded Chinese students studying overseas in 2009, up 20 percent from last year, said Wu Zaofeng, deputy secretary general of China Education Association for International Exchange. International institutions, Joseph said, are also facing increasingly tough financial situation with a shortage of domestic students and a drop in government subsidies . Students, especially in the US are paying high tuition fees and living expenses. Chinese students with money to spend, according to experts, can fill up the gap. Students on average spend 150,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan every year studying in US, according to statistics from the US Institute of International Education. During 2007-2008, there were approximately 81,000 Chinese students studying in the US, up 19.8 percent from 2006. Representatives from approximately 60 universities from the United States are planning to arrive in Beijing this weekend to attract more Chinese students at this year's fair. Besides the US, many other countries are also vying  to enroll Chinese students. Post-study work visa put out by British government allows all international students completing a UK degree qualification to apply for a visa to stay on and look for work in UK for up to 2 years. Being the third most popular destination for international students next to the US and the UK, France has set up two types of scholarships and has handed out an increase of 26 percent in scholarship funds to Chinese students in recent years. \n Question: The reason for heating up competition between international universities is   _  . \n Options: (A) that China has become one of the largest exporters of the students aiming to study abroad (B) that the students in China are becoming richer and richer (C) China's boom, the students' desire and foreign universities' commercial motive (D) that the students in foreign countries do not want to go to universities \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. It's not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is cooperative and another is competitive. Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of question. They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other, and there is a great deal of debate between _ of each theory. The argument is often conveniently referred to as nature vs. nurture. Those who support the \"nature\" side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological and genetic factors. That our environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and behavior is central to this theory. Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is predetermined to such a great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts . Proponents of the \"nurture\" theory, or, as they are often called, behaviorists, claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. Behaviorists see humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. Their view of the human being is quite mechanistic; they maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental stimuli (something that helps sb./ sth. to develop better and more quickly)as the basis of their behavior. The social and political connections of these two theories are significant. In the United States, for example, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligent test. This leads some \"nature\" proponents to conclude that blacks are genetically worse than whites. Behaviorists, in contrast, say that the differences in scores are due to the fact that blacks are often robbed of many of the educational and other environmental advantages  that whites enjoy, and that, as a result ,they do not develop the same responses that whites do. Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes. That the argument will continue for a long time is certain. \n Question: The author is mainly concerned about solving the problem  _  . \n Options: (A) why our personalities and behaviors differ (B) what makes different stages of intelligence (C) how social scientists form different theories (D) what causes the \"nature/ nurture\" argument \n Asnwer: B",

ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. It may be called a sixth sense. It seems to let people know about events before they happen, or events that are happening some distance away. Here is an example: A woman was doing washing. Suddenly she shouted, \"My father is dead! I saw him sitting in the chair!\" Just then, a telephone came. The woman's father had died of a heart illness. He died sitting in a chair. There are thousands of stories like this on record. Scientists are studying them to find out what is behind these strange mental messages. Here's another example ---- one of hundreds of dreams that have come true. A man dreamed he was walking along a road when a horse and carriage came by. The driver said, \"There's room for one more.\" The man felt the driver was Death, so he ran away. The next day the man was getting on a crowded bus. The bus driver said, \"There's room for one more\". Then the man saw the driver's face was the same face he had seen in the dream. He wouldn't get on the bus. As the bus drove off, it crashed and burst into fires. Everyone was killed! Some people say stories like these are lies or coincidences.

Her poetry often shows things that concerned her throughout her life, such as her search for a sense of home. Her troubled childhood and feelings of loneliness from this time affected her character and poetry. Bishop's painful childhood is apparent  in some of her poems. Her father died when she was eight months old and her mother was mad when she was five. Bishop was raised firstly by her mother's parents and then by her father's parents. This experience left her confused about belonging. She had no home and this was shown in her poetry. In \"A Prodigal\", when the character in the poem makes up his mind to go home, there is a sense of pessimism for Bishop who has no home. The lack of a sense of home has contributed to her depression  all her life. Bishop attempts  to make small, everyday experiences extraordinary in her poems such as \"Filling Station\" .In \"Filling Station \", Bishop describes the beautyof a family filling station. Although it is \"dirty\" there is order in it. Simple family life is celebrated in it. She recognizes the value of home and beauty in everyday life, but she is only an observer of these. Distance remains between her and the family at the filling station. Bishop's struggle to locate herself in the world is seen no more clearly than in \"sandpiper\". It deals with searching for something in a confusing world. She uses the metaphor  of the bird which is \"looking for something\". The \"something\" isn't specific . It seems as if the bird doesn't know what he wants; the only certain thing is that he is searching. Bishop's poems are personal on a more subtle  level, especially when her childhood, travels, etc, are taken into consideration. It is believed that Bishop is a complex poet who uses her poetry to find this feeling of belonging. \n Question: What do we know about Elizabeth Bishop's childhood? \n Options: (A) She was born poor. (B) She lived an unhappy life. (C) Her grandparents treated her badly. (D) Her parents didn't love her. \n Asnwer: B",

Two hours later my friend phoned me from the house. At the moment, he said, he was listening to some of my records after having had a delicious meal. Now, he said, he was drinking a glass of orange juice. When I asked him if he had had any difficulty finding the house, he answered that the only problem was that he had not been able to find the key under the doormat, but luckily, the living room window by the apple tree had been left open and he had climbed in through the window. I listened to all this in great surprise. There is no apple tree outside my window, but there is one by the living room window of my next door neighbor's house! \n Question: An old friend of mine called   _  . \n Options: (A) to tell me to meet him at the airport (B) to tell me about his arrival (C) to ask me to leave the office (D) to ask me to make plans for his arrival \n Asnwer: B",
