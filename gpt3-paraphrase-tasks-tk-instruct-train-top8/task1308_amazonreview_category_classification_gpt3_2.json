I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

The problem is, for some reason, they didn't receive the item and now they want to charge me.

I even took them apart and removed all the buttons to try to isolate the problem in case something was making contact. Even when nothing is touching the board, it has the same problem.
