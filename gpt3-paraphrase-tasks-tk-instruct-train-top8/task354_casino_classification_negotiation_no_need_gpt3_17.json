    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available). Output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the no-need strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The no-need strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy used when a participant points out that they do not need an item based on personal context, which suggests that the item is up for grabs and can directly benefit the opponent."
