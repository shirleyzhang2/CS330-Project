    "Definition": [
        "The input comes from a negotiation between two people who are pretending to be neighbors who are camping next to each other. They are negotiating for packages of food, water, and firewood, based on their individual preferences and requirements. If the utterance contains the elicit-pref strategy, output Yes, otherwise output No. The elicit-pref strategy is a cooperative negotiation strategy that is used to discover the preference order of the opponent in the negotiation."

            "input": "Context: 'What do you think if in the camp we get together and have a meeting between your family and mine? We can have a small party to get to know each other better.' 'Sounds great!' 'Ok, my proposal is to give you all the firewood you need, on the condition that you give me all the water I need. And regarding food we can negotiate.'\nUtterance: 'That sounds good. What do you propose on the food?'",

            "output": "Yes",
