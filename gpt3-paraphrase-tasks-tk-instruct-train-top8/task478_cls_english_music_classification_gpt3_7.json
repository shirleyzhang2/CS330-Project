I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

I can't figure this clown out, she gave Eminem's music 5 stars and said its really good and Eminem is just as if not more offensive to women as Snoop Dogg. You obviously think we're all dumb don't you? Snoop Dogg disrespects woman etc do you think we don't know that? I don't know you but I bet your are pure idiot. Lay off Snoop Dogg and any other rappers your trashing neg reviews on. Keep your f***** opinions to yourself Biotch!    Anyway I miss the old Snoop Doggy Dogg. It seems this guy can't top his debut however if you are a fan of Snoop like me you should purchase this album along with all the others   Doggystyle, Tha Doggfather, Da Game Is To Be Sold Not To Be Told, No Limit Top Dogg, Tha Last Meal, Dead Man Walkin, Tha Eastsidaz, Duces N Trayz THe Old Fashioned Way, R & G The Masterpiece, Welcome to tha chuuch Da album and probably some more I have not mentioned. Like I said it's not as good as some of the others but if you are a true Snoop fan click add to cart now.",

            "input": "Excellent performance practice, Complete recording . This recording of Messiah is an attempt at using period instruments (either authentic or replicas from the Baroque period) and performing it in the correct manner of \"Baroque performance\" (at least as best as we can know).  Clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off, but the result does seem to be very Baroque.      Reviewers have two main objections, which the prospective listener should keep in mind.  Many Messiah fans are used to \"un-Baroque\" performances of Messiah--a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone, a large orchestra, large dynamic contrasts, and slower tempos.  When people accustomed to such performances hear Hogwood's recording, it is often labeled as \"dry,\" \"unemotional,\" or \"light.\"      Other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself.  I think that the soloists could do a better job.  The bass is strong, but he could be better, and I think there should be more ornamentation overall.  I personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir, but others may differ.    Other Baroque recordings such as Gardiner, McGegan, or Harnoncourt are also good period recordings.  If you want more traditional interpretations, take a look at Thomas Beecham's or Robert Shaw's recordings.  If you're looking for a complete, scholarly interpretation, however, I think this is a great recording.  Oh, and the accompanying booklet is great, too--very thorough.",

Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, \"out of my body, out of my skin,\" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of \"One More Hour,\" the fury of \"Words and Guitar,\" the sexiness of \"Dance Song '97.\"  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart",

Well now he's back and better than ever with an all-new album featuring the new hit single \"We Are the Champions (Ding-a-Dang-Dong)\" based on the song by Queen.   Other songs include \"I Will Survive\", \"Ice Ice Baby\", and \"Copa Banana\".    In comparison to the UK import album, the US album exclusively has revamped versions of Eiffel 65's \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" and Rednex's \"Cotton-Eyed Joe\", two of my favorites.   The UK album, however, exclusively has froggy versions of \"I'm Too Sexy\" and \"The Final Countdown\", as well as the full version of \"Go Froggy Go\", the bizarre \"Crazy Jodeling\", and the even more bizzare \"Nellie the Elephant\".   Also there's \"Super Crazy Sounds\" which sounds so totally mixed up and around, if you know what I mean.    Either way, I like this new album a whole lot.   Better than the first, even",
