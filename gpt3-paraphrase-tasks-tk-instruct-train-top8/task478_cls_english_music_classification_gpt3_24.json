I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

(Even if you can't understand what he's saying, it's cool. Go look for translations then!) Anyway, I reccomend this cd to any Jpop or Jrock fan.

On the soundtrack to the movie STAYING ALIVE,the not-too-popular sequel to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,there are five original Bee Gees' compositions and recordings(THE WOMAN IN YOU,I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH,BREAKOUT,LIFE GOES ON and SOMEONE BELONGING TO SOMEONE). We hear an edited version of STAYIN' ALIVE(only the movie title carries the G). The originally released 4 minute and 42 second version of the song is heard during the film's end credits when John Travolta struts through Times Square. The film was directed by Hollywood great Sylvester Stallone,and makes a very short cameo appearance in the opening credits. Sylvester's brother Frank,appeared in the film as Tony,a bandmate of Cynthia Rhodes who played one of Travolta's love interests. Frank performs FAR FROM OVER,MOODY GIRL and with Rhodes, NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP. Rhodes performs FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY solo. The almost unheard of Tommy Faragher performs LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE and (WE DANCE)SO CLOSE TO THE FIRE. Released in 1983 as was another Bee Gees' production,Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album",

            "input": "so let down . I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation \"i'm your man\" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of \"if it be your will\" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. \"If It be your will\" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. \"mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . .\" or \"i am so very happy, so please hit me\" or \"river of sorrow, don't swallow\" or the breathy way he says the word \"twilight\" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.     Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says \"if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people\". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved \"if it be your will\" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort.",
