    "Definition": [
        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (whenever available). self-need is a selfish negotiation strategy. It is used to create a personal need for an item in the negotiation, such as by pointing out that the participant sweats a lot to show preference towards water packages. Output Yes if the utterance contains the self-need strategy, otherwise output No."

I am not that thirsty most days.'",

The only problem with it is that he dumps all the planning on me so I have to make sure I have extra of ANY possible idea he has.'
