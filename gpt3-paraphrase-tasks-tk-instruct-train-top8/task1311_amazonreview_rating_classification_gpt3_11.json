I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

Even though I\u2019ve used ski straps before, most didn\u2019t have a section to carry my skis and were too small to fit both skis and poles. The thing I like about this one is that it has a section for the skis and another section for the poles. All in all pretty pleased with this! \n Rating: 1",

Turns out that decision was a mistake. When I went to request a replacement due to damage... the item does not allow returns (apparently not even for damaged product). Normally I would make an assumption that this was an isolated case. But upon inspection of the packaging, I discovered the plastic is very rigid. So it seems to me that it this may be a common issue. More pliable plastic would have more bend/give rather than just cracking and breaking. \n Rating: 1",
