    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language that is regarded as taboo in polite usage."

As for blame, I would point to the constant stream of negativity and anger coming from left leaning publications. This shooter was 'a crazy' as many of the other mass shooters are. He was very deliberate in his actions. Then you state that it does not mean all Dems feel this way which I can agree with, but you then carry on to imply 'all Rs' as you finish.

What better way to help your team than taking a stupid penalty, which not only cost your team  said PP, it cost you 10 mins in the penalty box.\n\nYeah, Neil was great.\n\nOf course all the Sens' players are going to all sing kumbaya, they won.\n\nNow, any coach that dresses a player to play barely 2 mins of a game, that coach is handicapping his team, they're 1 player down to the other team, and that's not good.\n\nOtt is only still alive due to the NHL's insistence on using some bizarre scheme for the playoffs, in which the 6th and 7th seeds play in the 1st round, the winner playing the 5th seed, while the top seeded teams go at it.\n\nOtt is the only team that qualified for the playoffs that allowed more goals than it scored.\n\nGood for them, they've taken advantage, but they are wholly undeserving and really lucky.",
