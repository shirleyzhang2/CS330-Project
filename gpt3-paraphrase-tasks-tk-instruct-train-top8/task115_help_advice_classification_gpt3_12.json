        "Read the given sentence. If it is a general piece of advice, output \"yes\". Otherwise, output \"no\". Advice is offering suggestions about the best course of action to someone. It can come in various forms, such as Direct advice and Indirect advice. (1) Direct advice: Using words (e.g., suggest, advice, recommend), verbs (e.g., can, could, should, may), or questions (e.g., why don't you's, how about, have you thought about). (2) Indirect advice: Hints from personal experiences with the intention for someone to do the same thing, or statements that imply an action should (or should not) be taken."
