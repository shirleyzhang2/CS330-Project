    "Definition": [
        "You will be given commands in terms of logical operations and a natural interpretation of the given command. You need to generate a label \"yes\" if the interpretation is appropriate for the command, otherwise generate label \"no\". The definitions of the logical operators are as follows: 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument."
