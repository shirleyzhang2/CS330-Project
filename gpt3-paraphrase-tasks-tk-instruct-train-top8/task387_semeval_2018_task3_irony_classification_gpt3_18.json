        "In this task, you are given a tweet that contains some form of irony. Your task is to classify the type of irony the tweet has and label it as \"polarity\", \"situational\", or \"other\". Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations. Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence. Other kinds of ironies are neither polarity nor situational. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]."
