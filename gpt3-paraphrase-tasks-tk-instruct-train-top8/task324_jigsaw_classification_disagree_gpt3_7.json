    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. Your task is to classify the comment into one of two classes: agree or disagree. Disagree means that the comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Agree means that the comment is not likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

How do I know? Voters had the option of elevating the NDP, which is the anti-security, anti-surveillance, and anti-counterterrorism choice, to power in October 2015, but instead gave it resoundingly to one of Canada's two centrist parties, which despite their ideological differences basically do agree that the country needs to be at the cutting edge when it comes to national security.",

Don't forget that we should really be factoring in emissions being exported to foreign countries like China through proposals like Kinder Morgan.\n\nDonald Trump or no Donald Trump, the world is already well underway to a transition to an economy based on renewable energy. In the US much of the work is being done at the state level, and carbon pricing is already common in many other countries, particularly across Europe.\n\nThe challenges in Ontario have gone from poor implementation(from poor leadership) and restrictions faced through trade law. The actual big picture was the right one. A few Green MPP's would have helped.\n\nThe problem with Trudeau's plan is the proposed carbon tax(for provinces without carbon pricing) is too low, and you can't be serious about reducing emissions while simultaneously building pipelines. He's trying to please everyone at the same time. This makes for ineffective climate policy.",
