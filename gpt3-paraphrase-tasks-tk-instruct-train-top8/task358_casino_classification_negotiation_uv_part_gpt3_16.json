    "Definition": [
        "In this task you are given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). You need to output Yes if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output No. uv-part is a selfish negotiation strategy used to undermine the requirements of the opponent. For example, suggesting that the opponent would not need more firewood since they already have the basic supplies or a suggestion that there might be a store near the campsite where the opponent can get the supplies instead."
