        "In this task, you are given a public comment from an online platform. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two categories: obscene or non-obscene. A comment is obscene if it is considered offensive to the public sense of decency. For example, a comment is obscene if it too obviously relates to sex or contains language regarded as taboo in polite usage."

So, unless Congress changes it, which won't happen, then only those folks would benefit, not the Wilcoxs, or the Johnsons. Certainly the Courts would not allow the definition to be twisted to mean someone with 1/1024th blood.  \nThat's why the sovereignty activists are trying to push the definition to anyone with a Polynesian-Hawaiian ancestry to pre-contact Capt. Cook time.  Under that definition everyone with one drop is a Polynesian.  Of course there were no written records, so corruption as always in these hair brained schemes would be rampant.\nThis is now the year 2017.  What did anyone really think these race based Polynesian only programs, and segregated Polynesian schools would ultimately produce?",
