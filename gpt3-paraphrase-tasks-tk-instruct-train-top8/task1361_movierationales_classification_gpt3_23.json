she did n't .\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all -- and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy .\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins .\nthe film 's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan .\nseen now , it does not seem provocative .\nindeed , it 's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull .\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . nor does he bring anything new -- other than the locale -- to the material .\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for -- in a young couple 's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband 's mistress -- but they are brief .\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes -- grocery shopping , flower - arranging -- in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted .\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating .\nbut jia - li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence\n: they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties .\nat two hours and forty - five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long - winded . consider the defining moment for jia - li , the titular day on the beach .\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation .\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point .\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout .\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn - out narrative .\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle -- at least , it 's his name in the credits -- who is now rightly regarded as one of the world 's leading cinematographers .\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar - wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image .\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle 's inexperience or yang 's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible .\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .",

social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood 's financial and technical resources to create serious , \" personal \" or \" artsy \" movies . as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , did n't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen .\ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue .\nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood . serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of \" blockbuster \" philosophy .\none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre .\nuntil 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b - production domain .\nin late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction did n't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey .\nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies .\nhowever , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually does n't like it .\nas a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s .\nafter that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment .\nironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of \" new hollywood \" generation of young movie authors who made \" artsy \" and \" personal \" films in early 1970s .\ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti .\nboth movies were considered \" personal \" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular .\nin a sense , star wars is an also very \" personal \" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it .\nbut unlike many \" personal \" movies of the era , its \" personality \" was in line with the wishes of the general audience .\nthe plot , set \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away \" , begins in a time of civil war .\nthe evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic .\nin order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets .\nthe information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser .\nprincess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) .\nthose two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot .\nhis adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) .\nold man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force .\nafter some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force .\ntheir small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) .\ncritics who do n't like the movie , especially those who ca n't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of \" new hollywood \" , are prone to point the lack of originality .\non the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa 's samurai classic the hidden fortress .\non the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .\nthe others would find the author 's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long - haired , easy going , nature - loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .\neven out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art .\ngeorge lucas ' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well - paced segments between action and dramatic buildup .\ncharacters are well - drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster .\nwe have a \" coming - of - age \" hero , damsel - in - distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non - human characters .\nsome of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form .\nunfortunately , the same ca n't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford\n, only the last one had the character three - dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .\nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology .\noften comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground - breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas ' superiority over kubrick . however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they are n't the most remembered trademark of the movie .\nthat honour should definitely go to the \" oscar \" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career\n.\nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release .\nyet , even if they are immune to the george lucas ' magic\nthey should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture .",
