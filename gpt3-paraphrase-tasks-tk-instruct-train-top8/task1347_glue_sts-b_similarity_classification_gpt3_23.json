        "Original: Evaluate the similarity between the two given sentences and classify them into one of the following six classes, where 0 is the least similar and 5 is the most similar: 0: The two sentences are completely dissimilar. 1: The two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the same topic. 2: The two sentences are not equivalent, but share some details. 3: The two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs/is missing. 4: The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ. 5: The two sentences are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing."
