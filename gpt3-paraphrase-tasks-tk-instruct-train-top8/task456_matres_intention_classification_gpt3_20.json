        "You will be given a context and a verb separated by a newline character. Your task is to determine if the given verb implies an opinion, intention, or wish. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). Output 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, intention, or wish, and 'No' otherwise."
