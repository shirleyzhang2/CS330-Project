After the last few season's under UAA's worst coach of all time--Matt Thomas--he's worried about the tender feelings of his players concerning the numbers they wear ? Not only should these losing players have no choice in they're numbers--their names should be removed from the back as do many teams who believe it's all about team--not the player himself. The UAA hockey team has let down their school and given Alaska hockey a bad name. And we are to worry about what these players care about in their past ? Give me a break !  It costs the school more money to make the jersey with more than one single number on it. Two numbers makes the jersey weigh more , slowing the player on the ice. Instead of Woody reporting on the story UAA feeds him , why doesn't he pretend to be a real reporter and ask real questions ? Does Thomas feel he should have been fired after his worst winning record in D I hockey ? Will he resign if this season is just as bad ? Come Woody !  Man up !",

If pro sports and the TSNs of the world are about \"social justice\" first (of course, the players have no problem pledging allegiance to the $US and playing in whatever town pays them the most and/or where their friends are) and are just another vehicle of the progressive cause, then good-bye pro sports (and my money) for many people, I'm no longer watching.
