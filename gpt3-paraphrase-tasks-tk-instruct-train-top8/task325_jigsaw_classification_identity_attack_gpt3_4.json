Sadly, far too many prelates spread the lie that abortion is the most important issue, when sadly there really are no viable proposals to change the status quo beyond harrassment. That these bishops buy into this nonsense in support of the Republican coalition generally and Donald Trump in particular is shameful.\n\nThe Governor and Control Board saved the bondholders from themselves. They only think short term. If they actually learned from history they would not keep making the same shameful mistakes and would quit resisting Dodd-Frank.\n\nTrump is a creature of right-wing fake news, both as its subject and because he consumes it as his source of truth. This is beyond insane.",
