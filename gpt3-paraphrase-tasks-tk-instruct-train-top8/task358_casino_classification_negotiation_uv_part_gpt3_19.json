    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (if available). You will need to output 'Yes' if the utterance contains the uv-part strategy, otherwise output 'No'. The uv-part strategy is a selfish negotiation strategy used to undermine the requirements of the opponent. For example, suggesting that the opponent would not need more firewood since they already have the basic supplies or suggesting that there might be a store near the campsite where the opponent can get the supplies instead."
