Likely there were too many employees but the real problem is that there are way too many high-paid administrators. You could hire ~8 admins on what they pay one Vice Chancellor at the university, for example. So, for every 8 admins you fire - get rid of a Vice Chancellor and double your impact! As for the benefits that state employees get - they aren't that great for the newer employees. What's killing the state is the ridiculously generous benefits they gave to Tier I employees. Excellent retirement and 100% healthcare for the rest of their lives! You want a new nose - go get one, no problem. Finally, putting overly expensive speaker systems in classrooms isn't because teachers can't speak up - its because our school districts fall in love with every new technological gadget. The problem is the administration; and they are not going to cut themselves until they've decimated the workforce.",
