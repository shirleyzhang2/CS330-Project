Take care of it right thereThat makes more sense to me than trying to smuggle it illegally on a plane or the mail. Need to think outside the box here. Talk to Colorado. See what sort of suggestions they have for this? Would be worth a shot in my eyes...Alaska is way behind in getting this entire Cannabis movement going. Washington certainly didn't have this issue. If they did, they came up with solutions not \"aww what are we gonna do now\". Were almost two years in being legal and still no dispensaries or places to buy edibles and smokeless options. Sounds like Alaska is purposely dragging their feet.",

When I was a child there were ads on t.v with Joe camel and the Marlboro man. If you go back another twenty teachers were allowed to smoke in class. Smoking was the normal. Now there is no smoking  In schools and so forth dont smoke In cars with other people who dont smoke And so on. Smokers in general are much more few and far between then back then. Yet cancer rates and even diabetes rates have more than doubled? And they keep going up? Maybe look to the real culprits next time. Or even better spend that money on the real crisis in Alaska. Our prescription pill, Heroine and Meth population is going through the roof. Little known tid-bit for those who aren't In touch with society today. When you give someone presc. Pills and then take them off it later if they are addicted they will move right over to heroine. Thanks Doc! #WhyDontWeDoSomethingthatmatters!",
