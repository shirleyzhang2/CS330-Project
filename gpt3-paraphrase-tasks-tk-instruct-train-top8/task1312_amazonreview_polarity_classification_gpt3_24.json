I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

            "output": "positive",

I\u2019m regretting not finding them months ago!!! (Baby\u2019s 7 months old).

After 4 days of discomfort concluding with a missed day of work, I finally stopped and switched to the other product marketed to this demographic, and the symptoms went away. I don't know if it was just coincidence or if this product had the opposite effect intended on me, but one other commenter said the same thing, so I wonder if one of the ingredients is problematic for some people. I'd like to experiment to find out if it was just coincidence, but I don't want to feel that way again and will stay with the competition.",
