Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series.",
