            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.

In a report Sunday, the Pew Internet and American Life Project said 47 percent of U.S. adult Internet users have looked for information about themselves through Google or another search engine. That is more than twice the 22 percent of users who did in 2002, but Pew senior research specialist Mary Madden was surprised the growth wasn't higher. \"Yes it's doubled, but many Internet users have never done this simple act of plugging their name with search engines,\" she said. Americans under 50 and those with more education and income were more likely to self-Google because their jobs demand a certain online persona. Meanwhile, Pew found that 53 percent of adult Internet users admit looking up information about someone else, not including celebrities. Often, it's to find someone _ have lost touch with. But looking up information about friends, relatives, colleagues and neighbors also was common. Although men and women equally searched for online information about themselves, women were slightly more likely to look up information about someone they are dating. In many cases, the search is done to find someone's contact information. But a third of those who have conducted searches on others have looked for public records, such as bankruptcies  and divorce  proceedings. A similar number have searched for someone else's photo. Few Internet users say they Google themselves regularly ---- about three-quarters of self-searchers say they have done so only once or twice. And most who have done so consider what they find accurate.

Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat. The example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed. On hearing about this, Chow said happily, \"I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.\" Indeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life. Chow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including \"Shanghai Bund\"(<<>> ) and \"A Better Tomorrow\". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards. In 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world.

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way.      What makes a relationship healthy?     Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.     Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.     How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?     You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.     Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.     You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.  In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her. \n Question: The lessons you learn about the relationships in your teenage years may help you understand the following EXCEPT   _  . \n Options: (A) different kinds of relationships (B) different kinds of people and occasions (C) how to communicate in a positive way (D) what makes each relationship special \n Asnwer: D",

Everybody knows this and nobody would think of questioning this fact. Yet there are many people who do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by exercising it frequently either consciously  or unconsciously. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he doesn't give it enough chances to become strong.  If a friend complains that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault.

The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \" Are you standing or sitting?\" The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words. Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end... \"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground.

Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death.      Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce.    Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory       Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme.

            "input": "Article: Good Genes Mean Long Life Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have. For the lucky carriers of \"Methuselah\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  . The \"Methuselah\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\" he told The Times. \"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\" \n Question: According to the article, which of the following is the most important if a person is to live to the age of 100? \n Options: (A) Eating healthy food every day.

Then, why do people call them \"giraffes\"? A giraffe, they say, is an animal that sticks its neck out, can see places far away and has a large heart. It lives a quiet life and moves about in an easy and beautiful way. In the same way, a \"giraffe\" can be a person who likes to \"stick his or her neck out\" for other people, always watches for future happenings, has a warm heart for people around, and at the same time lives a quiet and beautiful life himself or herself. \"The Giraffe Project\" is a 10-year-old group which finds and honors \"giraffes\" in the US and in the world. The group wants to teach people to do something to build a better world. The group members believe that a person shouldn't draw his or her head back; instead, they tell people to \"stick their neck out\" and help others.
