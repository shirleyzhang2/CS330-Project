I really resent your dishonestly here in this discussion by making such a Straw Man argument. That is being quite underhanded.\n\nI'm not saying that all older drivers should be taken off the road.  I never said anything that remotely stated or implied that. I am just agreeing with Be.Carfree that being 66 is a strike against you.  It is a disadvantage.  Your reflexes and vision are not going to be equal to that of a younger person. And many people in their 60's do indeed have significant health issues.   Not everyone, naturally, but a significant number do.  So your risks are greater.\n\nThe factors of driving on a pitch dark country road in winter that had no lights in the area, and having so much alcohol in your blood were more important factors.   But being older is a disadvantage too.  It puts you at far greater risk of having medical issues that could also play a factor.",
