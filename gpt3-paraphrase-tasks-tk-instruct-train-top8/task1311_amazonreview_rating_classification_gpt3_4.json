I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed. \n Rating: 1",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color. \n Rating: 1",

An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product. \n Rating: 1",

I started getting nauseous in the car (just like I usually do). Then on our flight, I got so overly nauseous to the point that I thought I was going to throw up. I know the exact symptoms -- first I start getting sweaty so I told my husband that I wasn't feeling well. I started to panic because I could see out of the window how high in the air we still were. He gave me a plastic bag just in case. I will never rely on this product again. While we were away, I went and bought the regular Dramamine that I had always relied on. It did the trick. I'm throwing this one that I got on Amazon in the garbage. I always love everything that I buy from Amazon so this is a definite first! \n Rating: 1",
