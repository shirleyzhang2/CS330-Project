That brings me to my other problem with him: He attacks when he feels challenged or someone disagrees with him. Ask him about his sexist behavior, he calls you names. Have the temerity to ask for a breast-feeding break, he calls you disgusting. What if he had simply disagreed with Meghan Kelley that he is sexist or turned it around on her by asking her to explain what she meant? He never offers a solution - he only attacks. These behaviors are not those of a good leader. Are we all to start following such a leader? Are we all to start calling our neighbors, friends, family and co-workers fat or ugly or disgusting? I believe he is a coward and a child. He is not mentally fit to be the President of any country ESPECIALLY not the USA.",
