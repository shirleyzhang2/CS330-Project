It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer.

Unfortunately this album, lacking second guitarist Phil Sandoval, does not rock. Poor production values, even explained on the liner, makes it even less acceptable. I gave it the second star only because it was great to hear \"Can U Deliver?\" again and I can't find the now out of print \"March of the Saint\" first album. Buy it if you're a die-hard Saint fan like myself, but if you're looking for a good Saint album currently available get \"Symbol Of Salvation\" instead. It's pretty rockin'.",

However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his \"Helter Skelter\" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case.",
