            "input": "i swear i have seen the edge before .\nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film .\nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot .\nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker .\nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to\nadd humor and a few surprises to mess with your head .\none surprise , in particular\n, left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script .\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence .\neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them\nall .\nthe river wild was one of the best action / suspense films i have seen from the 90s .\nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and\nthe suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day .\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall .\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes .\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) .\nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes ' intensity , it could have become a great action film\n( and i use the term loosely ) .\nthe edge is pretty much a survival - of - the - fittest film .\nbut taking scream 's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre 's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) .\ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him .\nfor once , we do n't immediately care for the main character . instead ,\nwe like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles ' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness .\nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic .\ncharles ' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob .\nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect .\nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality .\n\" charles , bob , bob 's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter .\ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness .\ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations .\nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film .\ntake , for instance , the entire man - hunting bear plot .\nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears .\nbut given the charles ' intelligence , and bob 's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists .\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before .\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they did n't do the one thing that could save their life .\n.. thinking .\n\" despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything is n't as it seems anymore .\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise\n, so instead i will avoid it entirely .\nthe first two - thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles ' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice .\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility .\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water .\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ?\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide .\nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) .\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal .\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day .\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences ' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs .\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) .\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double - natured photographer .\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight .\nshe is n't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model .\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed .\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable .\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language .\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me .\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down .\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts .\ndavid mamet 's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid .\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which does n't end with the normal high - strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift .\nit 's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear .\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear .\nway to go , bart .",
