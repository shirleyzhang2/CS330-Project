Ideas can generate in garages, but now, with many cities across the nation offering such resources (collaborative inspiration environments), they no longer have to.  They can just move to others cities that have them.  Creating these allows Eugene (as a community) to get our share of the jobs and wealth created by these companies.  Fledgling companies already can get access to these resources, just nott here.   What you portray as selfish I consider to be enlightened self interest.  I am working to create opportunity in Eugene.  I could certainly do what I am doing elsewhere.  Is this what you suggest I (we) do?   On the workforce development issues, I can go into that as well but the space in these comments section is limited.  Let me know if you are actually interested and I will add more detail as well as expand upon topics I touched on.",
