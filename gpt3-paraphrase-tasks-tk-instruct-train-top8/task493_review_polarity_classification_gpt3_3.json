Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is.",

The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip. Much of the dialog about the \"troubles\" in Ireland went over my head when I saw the movie as a young women, hovever they made a real an impression this time. Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly.",

Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said \"No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit.\" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries.",
