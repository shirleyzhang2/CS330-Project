I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

            "input": "Some great country music by a great singer/songwriter! . When I first heard \"The Dollar\" on the radio, I was floored.   Not only by the touching lyrics, but also by the traditional sound.   I could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music, and was someone who stayed true to his roots.  After listening to this album, I still say all that.    THE DOLLAR is a great traditional country record.  Sure, there are the contemporary \"redneck anthems\"--\"Rebelicious,\" \"Redneck Side of Me,\" even to an extent \"Keepin' Up With the Jonesin\"--but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs.   Johnson's true country gift, however, comes across in other ways.   The enjoyable \"Flying Silver Eagle\" is one of the countriest songs I've heard in a long time (\"I couldn't put my past behind me, so I put it in a song\").   \"She's All Lady\" is a touching tribute to the woman at home, and \"Back to Carolina\" is a powerful number.   \"My Saving Grace\" is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol (\"Daddy passed out with his demons, Mama passed the offering plate...Daddy kept the Devil off my back by taking up His time\").  The CD ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number \"Lead Me Home.\"    Jamey Johnsom, from all appearances, seems the direct musical descendent of George Jones, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, and others--he's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude, but what is really, in fact, simple honesty.   THE DOLLAR is one of the best country albums I've heard in a long time.  Yes, yes, he's the guy who co-wrote \"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,\" but for true die-hard country fans, Johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here...and any more he gets the chance to record in his career.   His voice is undeniably country, his writing skills are formidable, and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering.   God--and the music industry--willing, Jamey Johnson will have a long career ahead of him.  Lord knows, he's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism",

More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's \"For Once In My Life\" and Glady Knight and the Pips' \"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them.  Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD",

Most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs, as would be heard in the movie. Then why not buying the movie? When I listen a cd I care about music, that is contaminated in this record.   And doesn't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently.  Besides, the art of the cover is very poor, dishonors the movie, and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus, recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear, improperly: the \"Oh No!\" sound of \"Frevo\" that is commented does not apear in the movie as said.   As a summary, Verve did wonderfull editions of jazz, but this edition falls far behind the standards of both Verve and the film; clearly, Brazilian music doesn't seems to be Verve territory judging buy this edition",

XTC didn't start out with any remote idea of aspiring to the very stifling punk classicism of the day.The only relation   'White Music' has to punk is the simple three chord structures.   Otherwise tunes like the catchy &quot;This Is Pop&quot; and the offbeat,   quircky reggae of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; have more relation to not only early British invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of American avante rockers.Neither is this in any way typical XTC-in years to come the band would   develope a sound much more melodic and sweet (neither of those   terms ever apply to this music) but the stuttering vocals and   Andy Partirdge's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.From a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally I find this album worth a listen-'White Music' will   definately command your attention.And it's not too loud either",

I have worn out this CD along with \"Elixir\", which is the next best one in my opinion. \"Yes, Please\" was the last CD before \"Heartfelt\". Although Heartfelt was good, it seemed like they are going in a different direction. I just previewed \"Journey\" and I have to say that i most likely won't be buying the CD, I'll just buy certain songs. If you want the definitive Fourplay collection, get every one of their CD's from the self titled debut to Yes, Please. You might even pick up \"Heartfelt\". If you want one of their best CD's, get \"Yes, Please\"!!",
