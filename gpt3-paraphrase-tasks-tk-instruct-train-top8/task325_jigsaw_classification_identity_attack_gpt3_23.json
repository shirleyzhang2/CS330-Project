And you can spell that any way you want. From what I've witnessed locally, online and via public posts by a slate of Democrat talking heads from Pelosi to Waters to Jackson to Wilson-Democrats are simply sore losers who can't get over the fact that Hillary was disliked by many people, including many women.",
