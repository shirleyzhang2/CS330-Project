The teacher made a mistake but it appears Larson thought it was compounded by the pinata representing Trump and not also Clinton. Would he have been so concerned with an image of just Clinton?\nThe student response defending free speech is perfect for Larson who also defends free speech. Are we being politically correct to see this event as offensive?\nImagine trying to teach government in this political climate. I would worry that showing some of Trump's comments about schlongs and male sexual prowess would get me in hot water. Parents will look for any excuse to attack teachers. Gone are the days when teaches had the respect they once garnered. \nLarson is no friend of teachers and the same with many of his followers. While teacher Tyler Nice will learn a lesson from this, the students will get the lesson that freedom comes with a price.",
