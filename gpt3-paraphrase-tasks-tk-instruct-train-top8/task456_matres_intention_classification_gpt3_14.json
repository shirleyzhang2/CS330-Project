        "Given a context and a verb, you have to identify if the verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. Please note that a verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). The output should be 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish, and 'No' otherwise."
