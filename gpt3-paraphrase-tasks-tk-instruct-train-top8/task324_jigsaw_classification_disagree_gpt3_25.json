        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: disagree or agree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

Like when my grandparents came to Canada penniless came from Europe after World War II?\n\nMy biracial children identify as Canadians - not white, not Asian, not rural, not urban - although all those elements help make them what they are.  My daughter has a good-natured time with people who ask her if she's latina (she'll speak a little Spanish to them and they'll quickly learn otherwise).\n\nWe don't need social justice activists to muck with our educational system and create fake white guilt in a society that is increasingly integrated in its diversity already.  All these SJW types do is create a problem where non-exists.  Instead of this negativity, how about channeling some positive energy towards helping those who need support to integrate into the communities that they move into?\n\nThanks to the mother and son for speaking up in this article.",
