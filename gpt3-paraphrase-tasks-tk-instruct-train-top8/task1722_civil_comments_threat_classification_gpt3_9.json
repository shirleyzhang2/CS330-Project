Most people couldn't hit the broad side of a LIO with a long gun, much less a pistol, and I've frequently seen people waving guns around with no care in the world for anyone's safety, their own included.  I've nearly been shot twice, both at ranges by someone forgetting to eject the last round from a chamber after removing the magazine.  Twice that I'm aware of.  Both of those times the weapons discharged; no one was hurt.  One guy who's gun went off while several people were downrange, actually laughed and the person next to him awarded him the coveted Black Eye of Stupidity and Failure to Know How This Danged Thing Works Medal.  Both were summarily ejected and asked not to return.  \n   \nBut thanks for your two cents worth.",
