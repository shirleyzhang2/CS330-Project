I have to turn it on and off multiple times for the static to go away. Sometimes the mic is not clear. I use to think that it was because I was away from the phone but even when the phone is in my hand it does not work. I paired it with my iPad and it was worse than using it on the phone. DISAPPOINTED in this purchase. It sounds like something that is short circuiting. I am very annoyed that I made this purchase and lost out on my money. To send it back I will have to pay return shipping. I hope the seller sees this review.
