        "You will be given a paragraph, an event from that paragraph, and an entity affected by the event. Based on how the event changes the state of the entity, you will classify the state of the entity into one of three classes: 1) not exist, 2) unknown location, 3) known location. \"not exist\" means the entity doesn't exist in that state anymore. \"unknown location\" means the entity exists in that state but location is unknown. \"known location\" means the entity exists and location is known."
