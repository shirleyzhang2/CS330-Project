        "Given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, you need to determine whether the given candidate sentence for the second sentence connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. If it does, output \"Yes\", otherwise output \"No\". A sentence is considered incorrect if it changes the subsequent storyline, such that at least one of the three subsequent sentences does not form a consistent story."
