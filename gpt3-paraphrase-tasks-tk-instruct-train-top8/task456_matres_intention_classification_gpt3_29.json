        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. Your task is to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, a wish, or not. A verb refers to an opinion if it is a judgment or point of view. A verb refers to an intention if it is an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). A verb refers to a wish if it is a desire or hope. The output should be: 'Yes' if the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish; and 'No' otherwise."
