up .\nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .\nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .\nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father 's home .\nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .\nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed - out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she 's going to .\nonce they 're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film 's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .\nbut since this is a family / friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and\nit 's all terribly interesting to watch .\ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly - farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .\nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .\nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make - up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot .\n\"\ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department .\nit feels like reality , like you 're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .\nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .\nwe see key moments in people 's lives that they would n't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically - showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it 's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three - dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the - truth - at - all - costs reasoning out of the water\n.\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they could n't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .\nand yes , it 's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier\n, we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he 's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .\neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .\nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .\nas such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it 's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .",

            "input": "it 's terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes ,\n\" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996 's unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office .\nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama .\nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist .\nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing ,\n\" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary .\ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits .\nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago ,\n\" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six - year - old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath .\nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there .\nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ?\n\" apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child is n't the focus of the picture .\ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist .\njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard - working wife .\none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces\nmaggie 's new - age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him .\nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he would n't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door .\nshe did n't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees .\n\" stir of echoes \" is n't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror - drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working - class family .\nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997 's \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top - notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems .\nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit .\nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet .\nin a masterfully - done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness .\nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater .\ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep .\n\" never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly - construed as this one .\ntruthfully , this set - piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen .\nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie 's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995 's \" to die for ,\n\" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films .\nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film\n: while talking to maggie about tom 's visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i would n't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she 's dead gives one pause .\n\" also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994 's \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998 's \" whatever , \" as morrison 's grieving teenage sister , debbie .\nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it does n't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty .\nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off - kilter frame - of - mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically - written characters .\n\" stir of echoes \" is n't as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ?\nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film .",

            "input": "based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst 's isolated island .\nhowever , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst 's rumoured plunder .\nwhile the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad 's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself .\nconrad 's heyst adheres religiously to his late father 's ways of detachment and isolation .\nhis ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice .\nthe struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe 's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst 's character , all that is left of conrad 's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement .\non the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe 's flat acting can not be excused as an attempt at stoicism .\nin the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another .\nthe final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad 's novel .\nits absence in the film is unforgivable .\nthe film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers .\nalma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst 's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with .\nthe struggle against heyst 's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma 's love for him .\njacob , fair - skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible .\nunfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script .\nthe couple 's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show - and - tell approach .\nall we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone .\nthis is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions .\nthe sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe 's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) .\nthe other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad 's meticulous characterization .\nwhile schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma .\nsam neil 's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft - spoken gentleman - at - large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as \" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror \" .\npoor characterization aside\n, kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder .\nsewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones ' back .\nat the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans .\ndespite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer ,\nvery few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended\n. sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be .\nthe delicately inter - woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production .\nat the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma 's victory was in teaching heyst how to love .\na hollow victory indeed .\nthe flying inkpot 's rating system :\n* wait for the video .\n*\n* a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !\n*\n* * pretty good , bring a friend .\n*\n*\n* * amazing , potent stuff .\n*\n*\n*\n* * perfection . see it twice .",
