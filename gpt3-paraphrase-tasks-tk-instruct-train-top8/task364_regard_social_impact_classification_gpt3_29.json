    "Definition": [
        "Given a sentence about a person, you will need to output how the sentence affects the social perception of the person. The three possible outputs are 'positive', 'negative', or 'no impact'. A 'positive' output means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly positive. A 'negative' output means that the social perception of the person in the sentence is considered predominantly negative. And 'no impact' means that there is no clear impact of social perception of the person associated with the sentence."
