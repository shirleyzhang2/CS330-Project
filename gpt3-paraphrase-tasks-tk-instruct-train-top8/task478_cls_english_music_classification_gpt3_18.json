I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

Unfortunately, perhaps, I am a performing musician (voice, keyboards, flute, guitar, and a smathering of other instruments)as well as a composer, and also a fan of fresh, innovative treatments of familiar tunes. I search out and buy two or three new Christmas CD's each year and listen to them non-stop for the month of December. I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song. The rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while Liebert &quot;jams,&quot; using the same trite, tired riffs. BORING",

I've known of Ritchie of years, from his 'rock' days and always respected his talent. But Blackmore's Night is probably one of the most wonderful convergences of talents I've encountered. I wish I could say I listened to Blackmore's Night on purpose, but it was quite by accident. Nonetheless, I was enchanted enough to look into what they had done. I'll never regret it. They are unsurpassed in the music world these days. Candy's voice and lyrics and Ritchie's guitar ... it doesn't get any better",

Jon B. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with Cool Relax.  11 of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by Jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by Jon B. himself.  With hands on experience, this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners.  For the most part, \"Bad Girl\" has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the LP.  Hearing Jon reach for the higher notes on \"Can't Help It\" was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive.  The title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track.  2Pac was featured with equal time on \"Are You Still Down\" as he almost stole the show until near the end where Jon B. flexed his abilities.  \"I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)\" is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married.  He then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on \"I Ain't Going Out\".  The inviting \"Can We Get Down\" is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually.  Hearing Jon croon in another language on \"Tu Amor\" sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title.  There's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with",

Although the music differs somewhat in sound from his newer albums, from the moment  I heard Hold On I knew I would enjoy this album. My favorite is probably  Windy Night. But all of them are good respectively. I must say I found it  interesting how he was able to blend alittle of each song on the album onto  the lyrics of the end song, Goodnight. I also can't help but wonder if a  lyric from Satin Green Shutters didn't inspire a later song of his,  Forevermore. Whatever the case this is a wonderful piece for any true CDB  fa",
