There has been excellent success reported  with scaring off cougar, bear,  coyote, deer, elk with some NON-LETHAL methods such as Flash Bangs, Rubber Bullets.  Alaska  State Troopers  and Alaska Residents have great  success scaring off Grizzly Bears using the Flash Bangs.   \n\nI have personally seen Cougar many times right here in the city limits in South Eugene.  There are Lotsa deer in that area.   Where there are Deer, there  are Cougar.  Deer are the Cougars FAVORITE Prey.  I have seen Cougar in peoples back yards with a Deer kill laying on the Deer  under a apple tree eating the Deer.  Totally Natural..........\n\nAs far  as a child getting killed, NOT many would like to see that.  If you live  in Cougar Territory, YOU or ANYONE should know where your kids are at at all times.",
