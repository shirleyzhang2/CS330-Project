The People of this State gave all of you lazy puds 90 days to get er done and yet you totally ignore it!  Now all efforts at anything have stopped because the House is playing politics.  Yes the issue is important, but if the steak isn't done, you can still eat a salad while you wait!  Or you can mow the lawn, anything but suck out of the trough and whine!\n\n$12,500 per day?  Flying home for the weekend and not getting back for work on Monday?  In the real working world you would be Fired!  You in Juneau have become as big a joke as our National Congress.\n\nI suggest another voter initiative, one which would stop all per diem after a 90 day session!  Another option would be sequestering all legislators in a motel 6 until the job is done.  Bread and water only!  Disgusting!",

Reporters asked the famous bank-robbing safe-cracker Willy Sutton a similar question, \"Willy, why did you keep robbing so many banks for so long?\".  \"Because that`s where they keep the money\" Willy answered.   Old criminals can add Dick, why can`t you and the rest of the oil shills?  The following chart does NOT include UN-conventional oil and gas from shale oil and gas fracking, or heavy oil, or hydrates.  Those have reserves as well as far as the state goes, even as unproven reserves.. they add value to being in Alaska sir, rather than Saudi Arabia where Exxon bid a production job to only make two dollars a barrel after costs.  They made 123% internal rate of return under ACES! They wanted more, and got it by illegally gerrymandering around certain \"enclaves\" of communities, then have their conflicted folks destroy ACES.",
