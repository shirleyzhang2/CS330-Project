            "input": "Article: Homework can put you in a badmood , and that might actually be a good thing. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children. The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes. In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others. The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experiment distracted kids from finding shapes. While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood. After eating a delicious ice cream, for example, write an essay. \n Question: Researchers did experiments on kids in order to find out _ . \n Options: (A) how they really feel when they are learning (B) whether mood affects their learning ability (C) what methods are easy for kids to learn (D) the relationship between sadness and happiness \n Answer: B",

Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth.  On 17 July, a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion.  About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned.  Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina.  Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long.  Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive.  Could it really happen?

            "input": "Article: As the new semester begins, millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper or, more likely, how best to delay that paper. Procrastination is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it. They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space, eating snacks, surfing the Internet, watching videos and looking at other students sitting around them, who, most likely, are doing nothing either. Paralyzed   by their habit to procrastinate, they write micro blogs about their fears, asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue. But this does nothing to break the spell  . According to a recent report, 95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are always procrastinating. The figures are disappointing. Procrastinators are less wealthy, less healthy and less happy than those who don't delay. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior, but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong. Many procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure. Pelling says this is nonsense, as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. The behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel ashamed, inconveniences others and annoys loved ones. Pelling also points out that procrastination feels particularly delinquent  in a society that thinks of speedy action as admirable, and, at times, even as a moral good. Fortunately, social scientists have thrown their weight behind efforts to understand this behavioral mistake and offer strategies to control it. Piers Steel, a Canadian social scientist and author of The Procrastination Equation, believes human is \"designed\" to procrastinate. Nevertheless, he suggests a couple of good ways to get through the task at hand. \n Question: Which behavior belongs to procrastination? \n Options: (A) Never dream away the time. (B) Always complete the tasks ahead of time. (C) Never put off till tomorrow what should be done today. (D) Always wait to work until the \"good mood\" or \"good time\". \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: Hardly a day goes by without the subject of money being raised in most people's lives. However, it is highly debatable   whether money is more important than other things, such as health and happiness, which some people consider to be of greater significance.   To begin with, it is often argued that having money enables people to exert their influence over others. Wealthy businessmen, for example, are often the most highly respected members of society, and business tycoons   are often referred to by world leaders, who then make policies that affect the whole population. As a result, money can be seen as the single most important factor in everyday life.   Secondly, from the point of view of the individual, money is vital for survival. Western society is structured in such a way that, without money, people cannot get proper nutrition and health care. Furthermore, in some cases, the inability to pay heating bills can indeed become a matter of life and death.   On the other hand, many people say that one of the factors in life, which is undoubtedly of greater importance than money, is health. As Izaak Walton said, health is, \"a blessing that money cannot buy\". What is more, money is sometimes of little comfort to those who are suffering from health problems. Despite the fact that money can buy the best medical care available, it is not a guarantee of a longer life.   In addition, most people would agree that personal happiness easily outweighs money in importance. Even if an individual is extremely rich, this does not necessarily lead to happiness. In some cases, the contrary is true, and vast wealth brings a whole range of problems. Genuine happiness cannot be bought and it is usually independent of financial status.   On the whole, although there are those who would rank money as the single most important thing in life, we, the vast majority, would disagree. \n Question: According to the text, money is   _  . \n Options: (A) not important to most people (B) sometimes the only comfort to sick people (C) a matter of life and death to the rich (D) always a hot topic in people's lives \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: \"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers. The answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer: The most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night. While we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust. For a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later. As I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys. When I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died. For a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son. My friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\" For the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye. It's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons. First: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me. Second: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital. From that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve. \n Question: When he was asked about the most important thing he had done in life at a presentation, the author    _   . \n Options: (A) felt it was not an interesting question (B) thought for a while and spoke his mind (C) gave an answer from a lawyer's point of view (D) didn't give the real answer \n Asnwer: D",

            "input": "Article: At night, bats fly through the air, catching hundreds of insects and other small animals. But during the day, they hardly move at all. Instead, bats pass the time hanging upside down from a secret spot. There are a couple of reasons why bats rest this way. First of all, it puts them in a position for takeoff. Unlike birds, bats can't fly into the air from the ground. Their wings don't produce enough lift to take off from a dead stop, and their hind legs are so small and underdeveloped that they can't run to build up the necessary takeoff speed. Instead, they use their front claws to climb to a high spot, and then fall into flight. During the hours when most enemies are active, bats gather where few animals would think to look and most can't reach. This allows them to disappear from the world until night comes again. There's also little competition for these resting spots, as other flying animals don't have the ability to hang upside down. Bats have a unique physiological adaptation that lets them hang around this way without using any energy. For you to hold your fist around an object tight, you contract  several muscles in your arm, which are connected to your fingers by tendons ;as one muscle contracts, it pulls a tendon, which pulls one of your fingers closed. A bat's talons  close in the same way, except that their tendons are connected only to the upper body, not to a muscle. To hang upside down, a bat pulls its claws open with other muscles. To get the talons to take hold of the surface, the bat simply lets its body relax. The weight of the upper body pulls down on the tendons connected to the talons, causing them to hold tight. Therefore, the bat doesn't have to do anything to hang upside down. \n Question: Bats hang upside down because  _  . \n Options: (A) they haven't developed a pair of strong claws (B) they can't start to fly from the ground directly (C) they have no hind legs to support their body (D) they can't find quiet places to stay during the day \n Asnwer: C",

            "input": "Article: Coral reefs  are not just beautiful to look at,but also very useful.They shelter nearly 25% of ocean life and provide food for billions of people.However, like many other species,this amazing ecosystem  is in danger of dying out! There are two main reasons for the destruction--the rising carbon dioxide levels caused by global warming as well as human influences like bottom operation.While not much can be done about the former,the loss caused by the latter can be reduced. Bottom operation involves dropping nets to the ocean bed and then dragging them up when filled with fish.This action damaged the ocean floor,causing the coral branches to separate from the reefs.While that is very discouraging,the good news is that if these branches are found quickly,they can be saved.At present,that work is being performed by volunteer divers. But the method has only limited success because they cannot stay long underwater, nor reach depths of over 200 meters where some of the deep-sea coral grows. However,this is not the case for Coralbots--the robots that can constantly seek out broken branches.A team of 'coral bots',each individually working to simple rules will piece together damaged bits of coral, allowing them to regrow. They are programmed to be able to distinguish between other things and the coral.The robots work together in groups,similar to bees.If one coralbot is damaged, then the others will still be able to complete the task. Dr Lea-Anne Henry said:\"The project of using coralbots offers us the possibility to restore  the function of reefs.It is in the final stage of testing.Once ready, the researchers hope to build hundreds of _ and use them effectively in the waters off Scotland and then hopefully in the oceans across the world.\" \n Question: Which of the following is a cause of the danger that coral reefs are facing? \n Options: (A) The appearance of new creatures.

            "input": "Article: When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores in certain kinds of tests or even the ability to do well in school. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or anxious situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do. For example, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And, if he can't make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he fails; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook  on life, special feeling about life, and knows how he fits into it. If you look at children, you'll see great difference between what we call \"bright\" children and \"not bright\" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out more about life --- he tries to get in touch with everything around him.

            "input": "Article: Doctors say anger can be an very harmful emotion unless you learn how to deal with it. They warn that angry feelings can lead to heart disease, stomach problems, headaches, emotional problems and possibly cancer. Anger is a normal emotion that we all feel from time to time. Some people express anger openly in a calm reasonable way. Others burst with anger, losing control of themselves. But other people repress their anger. They cannot or will not express it. For years many doctors thought that repressing anger was more dangerous to a person's health than expressing it. They said that when a person is angry, the brain gives off the same hormones that are produced during tense situations. They speed the heart rate, raise blood pressure, or sugar into the blood and narrow the blood vessels to the interstices . In general, the person feels excited and ready to act. Doctors said that repressing these feelings only makes the feelings continue. And this can lead to many medical problems. Doctors thought a person could prevent these problems by letting the anger out by expressing it freely. But recently some doctors held a different view. They said that people who express anger repeatedly and violently did become, in fact, more and not less angry. They said this,too,can cause medical problems. Some doctors say that both repressing and expressing anger can be dangerous. They believe that those who express anger violently may be more likely to develop heart disease, and they believe that those who keep their anger inside may face a greater danger of high blood pressure. Doctors say the solution is learning how to deal with anger. They say the first step is to admit that you are angry and to recognize the real cause of the anger, and then decide if the cause is serious. If it is, they say: \"Do not express your anger while angry. Wait until your anger has cooled down and you are able to express yourself calmly and reasonably. \" \n Question: What does the phrase repress anger mean? \n Options: (A) Forget one's anger. (B) Express one's anger openly. (C) Treat one's anger calmly and reasonably. (D) Keep one's anger inside. \n Asnwer: B",
