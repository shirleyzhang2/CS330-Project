I am very disappointed.",

These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I was extremely satisfied with the Lasfit headlamps I purchased. A very good value (price was affordable), easy installation (a have a Toyota FJ Cruiser) and great customer support. I recommend Lasfit over the plethora of competitors! The lights produce clean white beams of light, much better than my original factory incandescent bulbs.",

If it was larger it would create more friction. Since this area is small you really have to crank it down tight to keep from moving. With that said, It's almost perfect. Its sturdy and extremely light weight. Much better than the cheap spring type clamps.",

Upstairs we get several channels with good picture quality; however, in the living room where we watch TV the most we only get two channels. We have repositioned the antenna several times with no change which is very frustrating. I sent an email to the company about my problem and after a week I still haven't had a response which isn't good customer service. ALSO, when we were running the supplied cable through the ceiling it pulled apart so we ended up using the existing cable we were using for my old bulky antenna which pulled in all the local channels. It's very disappointing that the new antenna doesn't pull in all the local channels where we sit to watch TV.",
