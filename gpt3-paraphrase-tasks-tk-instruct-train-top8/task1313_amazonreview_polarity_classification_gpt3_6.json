These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints.

Because of this they are VERY uncomfortable. I had to put memory foam insoles in them, bandaids on the inside of the back of them, which has made a difference. But there is still a section that is poking the top of my left foot. Not sure what to do about that. Overall, I love the look but the feel and construction are horrible.

These are very sturdy, don't get tangled up, and with the two lengths they are be exactly what I needed no matter the situation. The whistles might be good for an older child, but needless to say, with a two year old, I threw the whistles away. They are LOUD. \n Polarity: positive",
