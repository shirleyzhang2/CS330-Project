    "Definition": [
        "Given a prompt and two completions from a language model, select the completion that is more relevant to continuing the prompt. A prompt-completion pair is considered to be relevant if the completion is logically related to the prompt and maintains relevance to the overall conversation. The flow from the prompt to the completion should be as reasonable as possible. Generate either Completion A or Completion B."
