I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",

Would fights between students take the form of teens using technology on each other? Would the students self-identify as members of Electricity clans or Chemistry clans? Seems threadbare, but you cold still write a book worth reading if you gave it a real plot and interesting characters. This book is the fantasy equivalent. It has the tired recycled tropes (\"I'm a Witch, and I'm going to show off by casting a glowing light!\") without the story that would redeem them. \n Category: digital_ebook_purchase",

I will do everything I can to get Amazon to ban this seller. when I messaged her return they sent some can message saying that they had a bad batch and they returned it and are no longer selling it.

After 4 days of discomfort concluding with a missed day of work, I finally stopped and switched to the other product marketed to this demographic, and the symptoms went away. I don't know if it was just coincidence or if this product had the opposite effect intended on me, but one other commenter said the same thing, so I wonder if one of the ingredients is problematic for some people. I'd like to experiment to find out if it was just coincidence, but I don't want to feel that way again and will stay with the competition. \n Category: drugstore",
