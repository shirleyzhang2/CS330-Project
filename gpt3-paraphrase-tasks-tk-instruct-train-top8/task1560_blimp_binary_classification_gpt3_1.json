        "In this task, you will be given an English sentence. You need to classify the sentence as either a representation of an anaphor number agreement or as an incorrect representation. A correct representation of an anaphor number agreement will be a grammatically correct instance of a sentence where the subject and self-referencing nouns match plurality. An incorrect representation is a sentence in which the subject and self-referencing noun's plurality do not match."
