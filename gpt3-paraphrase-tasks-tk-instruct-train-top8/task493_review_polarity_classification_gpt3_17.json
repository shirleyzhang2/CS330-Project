Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season. The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper. The only problem? The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: \"The Ropers\" and \"Three's a Crowd.\" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication. Watch this set and you'll see why.",

The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me.",
