When we arrived, the hostess, when she finally quit talking on her phone, couldn't find our reservation and seemed pretty snotty about it.  We went upstairs, found our people, and spent the next two hours trying to get the attention of the bartenders, to little avail.  The music was too loud for conversation.\\n\\nSummary: VERY noisy, terrible service.  I'd tell you about the food, but the food we ordered never arrived.  Wild dogs couldn't drag me back.",

It has a similar, health focused menu and will delight those looking for fresh, organic dining.  Menu selections include healthy pastas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, breakfast, juices and burgers.  \\n\\nI'd highly recommend their bean burger ($7.50).  The burger comes with a black bean patty and caramelized onions on a whole-wheat bun.  This wasn't your typical freezer section black bean patty--it tasted homemade. It was phenomenal.  The bun was also warm and homemade--another win!\\n\\nEach of the burgers come with a salad, fruit or sweet potato fries.  I enjoyed my side salad but the dressing (I think it was some type of vinaigrette) was pretty bland.  I'd prefer more seasoning in the dressing.\\n\\nThe Ahi Ahi tacos were also pretty good but, at $9.50, I wish they came with some type of side.  Three small tacos sitting in the middle of a large plate was less than visually appealing. I felt bad for the tacos, they looked so pathetic and small.  However, the tacos were nicely prepared (although slightly underseasoned) and the tuna was good quality.  I'm not sure I'd order this again.\\n\\nI can't wait to go back to try their organic breakfasts and juices (and eat 500 more black bean burgers).  They better not move!\\n\\nAlso, please note: DK is a yuppie magnet.  You have been warned.",

And I've not experienced diminished sense of smell as had been reported in a class action suit from 2006.  [Link]   But I tried using the Oral Mist, Mint flavor as an alternative to the Nasal Spray - seemed more dignified than the nasal gel during a recent all-day business meeting.   I stopped using the product after two days of use because it left a lingering metallic-sour flavor in the mouth.   A mild sense of nausea is also present.  It's been a day since discontinuing use, and these symptoms have not diminished to any degree.   So my cold has gone away for the most part, but overall I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth with this product.",

I sat in my auntie's old El Camino happily eating my strawberry shortcake when my auntie stopped at a red light on the corner of 20th street & Van Buren when out of no WHERE a crack head with a gun tried to car jack us. My auntie yelled and threw an half empty bottle of tequila out the window as she sped threw the intersection. This was more than 10 years ago and things haven't improved much since that day in this neighborhood.\\n\\nWhen I read about Baiz Market it was from my fellow yelper Jim W. who ranted and raved and even encouraged me to check it out. The other night not having much to do, my friend Ree & I decided to go to Baiz Market which is just north of the intersection where my auntie & I almost got car jacked and check it out. We both have love for middle eastern food and know how to take on scary neighborhoods. \\n\\nWhen we walked up to the counter of the deli inside the quaint grocery store we were excited and a little scared of what to order. The cashier was SO patient and VERY nice about explaining everything to us! I really must give her props on that. There was a cab driver who was very helpful in explaining the different dishes and even recommended a few items. I listened to Tarek S. and chose the beef Shawerma it was delishous! My friend chose the chicken toolawoosh (is that spelled right?) sandwich which was very good with it's bell pepper, pickles and tomato fixins. We also chose to sample the small spinach pies which weren't that good btw and cheese pie which I could make at home with pizza crust & some cheese and the yummy yummy hummus that came with some pita bread. We also got a bottle of water and a can of imported orange soda. ALL this for only $27! Can you believe that?! \\n\\nThe dining area was nice and quiet with mellow middle eastern music on in the background. Everyone kept to themselves and was nice to us even though we backed up the line. \\n\\nAfter our meal we wandered around the candy aisle in the grocery store and found lil heart shaped boxes of chocolates which - ummm wasn't that great! lol. We wanted to spend a heck of a lot more time going threw every aisle but unfortunatly they were closing so we had to leave. \\n\\nWe will DEFINATLY be back! And prolly with a few more in tow. And no, no one tried to car jack us on our way out... but we did see a tranny hooker get questioned by the cops. Maybe if she went to Baiz Market for some baklava instead of walking the streets she wouldn't be in that situation! I'm just saying. To my yelpers, I say go! and when you go, order the beef shawerma and avoid the spinach pies! Oh and get there before 4pm so you can have time to really enjoy your meal without the rush!",
