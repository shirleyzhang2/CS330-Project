            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",

But too often these days we get hundreds of 'anectodal opinion' pieces that promote the only 'correct' viewpoint society should have. These feel good groupthink pieces are largely spurious, fallacious or based on little reasoning or hard statistically relevant data. Thus, when an opposing viewpoint is published that in a mere few thousand words attempts to bring rigorous, rational and data supported thinking back to the debate; I for one applaud it, even if it is not 100% perfect or complete.\n\nI do hope Ms. Soh is not silenced and continues to write such reasoned, data based and as objective as possible, articles.",
