I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

            "explanation": "The user seems perfectly satisfied with a product where they didn't even have any complaint and they even bought more. So, he gave this product 5 stars considering it extremely good. So, it's a positive review."

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

Other reviewers have noted that the well area for the sticks isn\u2019t deep enough, but there are hacks. Slice down further, roll suckers in after hard sugar is poured, etc. You\u2019ll figure it out. I love these. I don\u2019t even spray them down. They pop right out and are forgiving. I\u2019d say they make average sized suckers/lollipops. Not mini, not big. Just right.",
