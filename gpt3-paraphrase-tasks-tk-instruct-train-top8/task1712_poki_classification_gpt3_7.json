        "You will receive a short poem written by a kid. Based on the poem, you will need to predict if the kid is currently in elementary school or high school. Elementary school is defined as grades 1st through 6th, and high school is defined as grades 7th through 12th. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output, and no input can have both outputs at the same time."
