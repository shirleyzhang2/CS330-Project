The bags are made of a plastic seems like a durable material. The bags were very nice, big and fix lots of clothes inside, I used bed sheets. I put the sheets inside the bag, closed the bag. You'll receive a small plastic part to help you close the bag. But when it came to taking the air out with the pump, I was extremely dissatisfied. The product did not live up to my expectations. I was extremely excited to try this product. Maybe if used with a vacuum the outcome would be different?? Not sure. I would not recommend this product.

I have pressed these buttons so many times but nothing ever happens !! It was also suppose to be able to add your own numbers to block. However, every time I tried, I would always get a recorded message from my phone company telling me I was doing some thing wrong and would then hang up on me.

I cannot seem to get any help from this company so please don\u2019t order if you love your pet! The smell of the car seat was completely toxic, I aired it out before use, over a day, as I had read this from other buyers. The smell did not go away, I tried to use it but the toxic fumes from the seat made my dog begin to vomit after sitting in it for about 30 minutes. I should have known when he began sniffing it when placed inside and then kept sniffling while inside and kept trying to get out of the seat and away from the smell. Do not purchase if you are concerned for your dogs safety. Unless you want to go to the vet when your dog begins vomiting from the fumes, then I do not recommend this as a purchase. Also, the quality of the car seat was terrible, the price did not match up with the quality. The worst purchase I have made In the 6 years I have been with Amazon. \n Summary: Do not purchase if concerned for dogs safety or if you want customer service",
