I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the \"boy band\" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost",

I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the \"music\" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.",

            "input": "The Purple Genius . Three hours of perfect Prince is hard to believe.  Here it is.  All the grooves are present.  All the funk.  The indulgent boudoir ballads.  The ambiguous spirituality. Cameos of soul & gospel & rap. If you've ever liked any Prince song, then you're bound to find another favourite on this explosion of creativity.  *  Of course there's a reason this album is so overwhelming, both in terms of quantity and quality: it represents the best of five years of songwriting.  Allegedly in 1991 or so Prince walked into the Warner Bros. offices and dumped five albums' worth of music into their laps, thus fulfilling his 'contractual obligations' for the next five years.  He then went home and continued to write songs.  Once 'emancipated' from WB, free to form NPG music, he released this treasure trove.  Without normal distribution, however, it \"only\" reached No.11 on the Billboard Album Chart, and spawned only one single.  Crazy stuff.  There's enough musical genius here for three or four chart-topping albums and a host of singles.  *  There are DVDs available of Prince's more recent lives shows, featuring consumate musicians, such as Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, but none more distinguished than Prince himself - his performances are terrific and showcase his enormous talent.  Music is his life.  He can play virtually any instrument, sing, write, arrange...dance.  What's more, he enjoys himself on stage - and it's hard not to share in it all.  The DVDs are ideal complements to this CD set.  *  I think this is one of his best ever albums, and one of the best pop albums of all time.  Having heard almost all his work, this would be my desert island recording.  I've wondered why the praise for it has been less than universal and concluded that in a strange sense it is \"too good\" - there are at least twenty songs that could have been Top 10 hits, and which beg to be treated as 'favourites' - normally, I'd listen to an album and come back to 2 or 3 songs repeatedly - here, that makes for a difficult choice - what's more, since these songs have been starved of airplay they don't bring that welcome nostalgia of a popular hit, no memory of dancing to this or that at a party - it's almost like listening to a great new song for the first time.  Also, there's no filler, nor is there a \"theme\" which allows for half-attentive listening - every four minutes another great tune shouts out and demands to be heard!  It's so good that it's almost hard work!",

While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest \"Definitive Collection\" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here.  Steely classics such as \"Do It Again\", \"Reelin' In The Years\", \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\", \"Black Friday\", \"Deacon Blues\", \"Peg\" and \"Hey Nineteen\" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day.  While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic \"Josie\". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including \"Josie\" and dropping a track like, say \"Dirty Work\" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.   Apart from this, Steely Dan's \"Definitive Collection\" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation \"Show Biz Kids\" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more.",

I was very disapointed.      Would be much better in chronological order.  It is in some places, but then jumps around for no apparent reason.      It seems like Barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is, and he is very talented.  It is just this box set tries to do too many things, and accomplishes nothing.

This cd is easy to find at most stores and often sold at a low price, so there is no real reason why you can't go pick it up right now. This record is best heard at 3 am with headphones on. Yoshimi was my first lips record, and the main difference between \"Soft Bulletin\" and \"Yoshimi\" is the production values. This recording has a big lo-fi sensibility to it. Steven's drums are always loud, boomy, and usually crackling, like they recorded way too hot. At times the record seems overloaded with sounds, and at first, I thought it would have benifited from the more prestine \"Yoshimi\" production values. It has grown on me though. I don't really understand the point of having \"Race for the Prize\" and   \"Waiting for Superman\" (the weakest track on the album) in two seperate versions. To me the record would have ended perfectly on \"Sleeping on the Roof\".",

Most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs, as would be heard in the movie. Then why not buying the movie? When I listen a cd I care about music, that is contaminated in this record.   And doesn't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently.  Besides, the art of the cover is very poor, dishonors the movie, and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus, recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear, improperly: the \"Oh No!\" sound of \"Frevo\" that is commented does not apear in the movie as said.   As a summary, Verve did wonderfull editions of jazz, but this edition falls far behind the standards of both Verve and the film; clearly, Brazilian music doesn't seems to be Verve territory judging buy this edition",
