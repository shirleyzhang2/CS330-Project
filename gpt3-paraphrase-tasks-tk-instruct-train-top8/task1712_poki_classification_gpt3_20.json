        "You will be given a short poem, and your task is to predict if the author is in elementary school or high school. If they are in any grade from 1st to 6th, they will be considered as in elementary school. If they are in any grade from 7th to 12th, they will be considered as in high school. There are only two possible outputs: elementary and high. All inputs will have at least one output, and it cannot have both categories at a time."
