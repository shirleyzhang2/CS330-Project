Studies indicate that 20% of all white people have used multiple kinds of illegal drugs, compared to 10% of all blacks and Latinos. Whites use more methamphetamines, hallucinogens, OxyContin and cocaine than other ethnic groups. Black people, however, are arrested at three times the rate that whites are for drugs. On average black people, who comprise just more than 10% of the population, whose drug use is half that of whites, are arrested three times as often on drug charges as whites. So, the higher rate of drug use in the Caucasian population that outnumbers the minority population by almost ten to one, means that black people are arrested on drug charges at a rate of 20 times that of white people for the same offense.  Again, it seems that if people are concerned about illegal drug use and distribution, the Caucasian population is where the action is.",
