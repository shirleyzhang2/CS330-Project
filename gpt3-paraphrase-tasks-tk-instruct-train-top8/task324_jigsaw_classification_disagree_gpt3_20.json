        "You will be given a public comment from an online platform. You need to classify the comment as either 'disagree' or 'agree'.

The disagreement can be due to toxic content, controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as 'agree' if it is not likely to raise public disagreement."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

I didn't feel as though there was some Asian privilege going on.  Rather I realized it was the market.  If there were enough white dudes who wanted to buy something it would have been there.  But there weren't.  I never thought of boohooing about it and claiming I was discriminated against.  Instead, I tried new foods and enjoyed the culture that I was so lucky to get to enjoy.  Now, back home, I have such fond memories and now I search out the foods at Asian markets that I ate and loved when I was there.  And I introduced foods to my family members.  I was appalled when a family member had never had a mango.  We got some and he loved it!  \n\nThis white privilege business is nonsense by social justice warriors who never lived through the hard times and want to make a mountain out of a mole hill.",
