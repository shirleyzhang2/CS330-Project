We waited at least 2 in the waiting room before being called back to get an ekg done.  Once that was taken we waited another 2-4 hours in the room to be seen.  Once that occurred we were then taken to yet another room where we spent another 1-2 hours waiting to get any results.  The nurses that were there that night couldn't find any solutions as to why he had these fainting spells.  I then even suggested to do blood work to see if anything could be detected from that.  If I hadn't even suggested it they wouldn't have administered anything else and would have let us go.  Still after 7 hours nothing was resolved and we still don't know why he fainted but thank god he hasn't had any more since then!",
