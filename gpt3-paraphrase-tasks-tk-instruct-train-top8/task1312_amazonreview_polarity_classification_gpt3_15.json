I have used infrared lights for my ball python for many years now and I get a varied range of months from a bulb, but I have never gone through two bulbs in a matter of two months! I am very disappointed.",
            "output": "negative",

            "input": "Love it! Truth be told, I find regular bras annoying to wear so practically live in sports bras. These caught my eye as providing my cleavage a bit of a boost as well as having a more...attractive look than your typical sports bra. Would I wear it on a jog? No, I really don't think it would provide me comfortable support. But for everyday wear and light activity? Absolutely no complaints. Matter of fact, after buying the black as a test run, I ended up buying every color.",

I cannot wear this top and am really disappointed about that, It is advertised as XL but seriously this top would only fit someone who would be a size s/m. An XXL would have been a better choice for me because the sizing is incorrect on this product.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "It's a negative review. The user seem so dissatisfied with the product because the size didn't fit them. So negative is the correct answer."

            "input": "I have been desperately looking for a dress in this style that is ACTUALLY a polyester spandex blend, as I have several dresses made of this combination that have lasted forever and wash really well. However, the dress I received is made of 95% RAYON and 5% spandex (this is stated on the tag). Based on my experience with previous dresses made of a rayon spandex combo, this tends to be an unpleasantly clingy material that doesn't drape well, tends to get holes, and pills after a few washes. I tried this dress on, and as with other dresses I've had made of this material, it clings in a very unflattering way. I will be returning this dress and I'm very disappointed. I wish Amazon would make an effort to verify product descriptions!!!",
