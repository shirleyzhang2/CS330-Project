However, from the time the waiter took our drink orders to the time we received the drinks was about 30 minutes. The restaurant was about 25% full.\\n\\nOnce we were able to order, everyone ordered an appetizer salad and an entree. One of us asked for anchovies on the Cesar salad. 4 of the 5 salads arrived around 8:45.. no anchovies. My salad never came out, and our waiter was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nOnce the food arrived, the anchovies were found on my co-workers pizza instead of the salad. I finally found the waiter, and I asked what happened to my salad and he sent over a manager. She told me she'd \\\"\"go ahead and take the salad off your bill\\\"\"... which I was like, \\\"\"thank you for not making me pay for a salad I never received\\\"\". Are you serious?!!?? Then she gave me a \\\"\"free\\\"\" piece of cake. I don't understand - I wanted a salad?\\n\\nThe rest of the food was ok, nothing spectacular. I had a pepperoni calzone. The decor of the place is very cool, and they have some great music. But if you want to have dinner in less than 2 hours and receive great service: I'd go elsewhere.",

Lots of energy - I would use \\\"\"perky\\\"\".\\nGreat backing vocalists and musicians - very tight.\\nPerformance seemed to fly by.\\n\\nI've seen Elton John, Celine and Rod Stewart in the same venue & though Rod was the best of the four IMO (I can't believe I'm writing this) - Shania comes in at a close second.",

We both commented that the rooms are big, clean and the mattress was so comfortable ( where can I get one for the house)\\nAfter unpacking, we quickly hit the Lobby Lounge and was treated like Kings by Katherine who served us some of the best cocktails I Have had in a long time.\\nWe both commented this was going to be a great stay in LV for work related business if this is a clue. \\nWHAT A SHOCK! \\nIt was all down hill after the first night. We decided to go back to the Lobby lounge and was completely ignored by the new servers, who BTW knew we was sitting in the side lounge BECAUSE I asked if it was open. We ordered the same drinks but it was made completely  different. Didn't even have same color, so you knew something was missing. All I knew was the night before it was so freaking good and tonight - like we was at a different bar.  Took 15 min to get 1st drink, and 50 min later I was at the bar asking to cash out for it seemed we had been forgot.\\nNight before? Our tab was $185 not including tip, we could careless for it was a perfect night. But the second trip, horrible.\\nI even noticed a table of 4 sit and leave because they couldn't get a server, AND NO-IT WASN'T that busy. \\nThe rest of our stay ranged from poor service at the food courts to the high price end places, just not worthy to waste my time about it here.  \\nMy friend and I commented it's a number's game, we rolled the dice 2nd night and lost -- MGM, lost two clients. ( We both have stayed here before) \\nBest of luck MGM, get more like Katherine, the lady knows customer service. Have your bartenders use same recipes!",

Its located in a shady strip mall with that just looks that way... you'll be fine.  its open 24/7 and perfect for late night munchies.  I always went with the carne asada tacos and el pastor tacos.  The  thing that set this place apart for me that the quality of the food is always consistent. The asada tasted awesome every time I've had it. Cant remember ever having any kind of negativity experience at Pepe's .",
