This man is a fraud, liar and all around horrible business man.Many of you are refering to a man named Dan, but the payments I made were for a John Pamo....My company paid a deposit for work to be done on an engine in December. After weeks of calling to try and schedule a time for him to come and fix the truck we were unsuccessful. We needed to get the truck fixed (this is a business truck and were spending $5,000 a month for a rental) after waiting 2 months for him to fix it we finally hired another company (someone reliable) to actually fix the problem. We filed a claim through PAYPAL and American Express but this man lied about work done and not being paid... We paid him to look at the truck the first time and decided to give him the rest of the job.It is now almost March and we still have not been able to get our money back. Guess it's time for small claims. BEWARE!!!! Do not give this man any money!!!",

The Lobster was really filling, it was just delicious! Then they asked if I wanted dessert, \\\"\"What do you have?\\\"\" I asked. Then they bring me a cart full of all the desserts they had. \\\"\"WHOA\\\"\" I said, well since I was eating with a group, we just got everything! It was delicious, pretty exquisite, perfect!

Nevertheless, Lobbys impressed me.\\n\\nTheir menu is a bit confusing to read, but after standing in line for a few minutes, I ordered the regular cheeseburger, added the grilled mushrooms, and kept the pickles off. I liked the taste a lot, but next time, I will probably order the double burger, because the single wasn't quite enough.\\n\\nThe place itself was very clean (hard to do in a restaurant serving burgers and dogs) and the service was friendly. I recommend checking out Lobbys soon!",
