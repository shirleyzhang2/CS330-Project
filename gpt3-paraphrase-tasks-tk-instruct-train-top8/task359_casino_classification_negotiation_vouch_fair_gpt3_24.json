        "You will be given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances. You need to output Yes if the utterance contains the vouch-fair strategy, otherwise output No. Vouch-fair is a selfish negotiation strategy which is used to call out fairness for personal benefit. It can be either an explicit call out or can be implied."
