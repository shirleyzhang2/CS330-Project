I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

The mesh over the face is very fine but seems strong as well. The mesh on the ears is soft, but the holes are apparently too big for the tiny bugs. I came home from work today to find my horse frantically shaking his head. I removed the mask and found it full of gnats. My horse's face and poll were bloody. There were also blood spots on the mesh. The pictures I posted are of the onside of the mask. The white fleece liner is full of gnats, and the inside tip of the ear was crammed with them and dried blood from my horse's ear. \n Category: home_improvement",

I wanted privacy because my bf is super nosey, always trying to read my messages as I text. First off this does come with everything you need to install it. I really liked that. Installation was simple and very easy. The first few days I didn\u2019t really have a problem with it, outside of the fact that fingerprints did stay on the screen rather easily. My problem arose when the screen protector came off. I didn\u2019t notice until I went to use my phone so I have no idea how long it was off. I cleaned the screen and put another one on, and not even 2days later it started to come off again. Although the screen works well, clearly it does not have enough adhesive to keep it stuck to the screen. I won\u2019t be buying again. I\u2019m now on screen protector #3 in less than 2wks. \n Category: drugstore",
