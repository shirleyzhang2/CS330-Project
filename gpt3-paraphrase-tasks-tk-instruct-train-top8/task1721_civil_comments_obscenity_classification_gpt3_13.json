In 2014 it was 24.2 per 100,000. That is a significant drop of almost 2/3s.  Studies have shown the sex education is the biggest factor in this decline. Places which have limited or no sex ed have higher birth rates among teen mothers.\n\nhttp://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-health-topics/reproductive-health/teen-pregnancy/trends.html#",
