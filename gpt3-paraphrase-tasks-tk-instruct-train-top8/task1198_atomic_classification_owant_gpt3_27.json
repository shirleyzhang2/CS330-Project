    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given a tuple consisting of a Head and a Tail event, separated by <sep>. The Head and Tail events are short phrases involving one or more participants. The names of specific people have been replaced by generic words (e.g., PersonX, PersonY, PersonZ). PersonX is always the subject of the event. You have to determine whether, as a result of the Head, PersonY or others will want what is mentioned in the Tail. In this task, wanting is a postcondition desire on the part of PersonY and others, respectively. For example, as a result of PersonX giving PersonY gifts, PersonY may want to open the gift. Classify your answers into \"Yes\" and \"No\". The phrase may also contain \"___\", a placeholder that can be an object, a person, and/or an action."
