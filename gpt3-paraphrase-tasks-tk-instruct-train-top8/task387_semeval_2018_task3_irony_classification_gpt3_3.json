        "In this task you are given a tweet that contains irony. You must classify the type of irony the tweet has. Label the tweets (\"polarity\",\"situational\",\"other\") based on the irony they have. Situational irony happens when a situation fails to meet some expectations, Label these instances as \"situational\". Polarity irony happens when irony is achieved by inverting the intended sentence, Label these instances as \"polarity\". There are other kinds of ironies that are neither polarity nor situational, Label these instances as \"other\"."
