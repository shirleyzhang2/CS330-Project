I unpackaged the entire chair and hardware before noticing this. So, I'll spend twice the amount of time boxing up the whole useless thing and send it back with a 1-star review of part of a chair I never got to sit in. I will go so far as to include a picture of what their injection molding and quality assurance process missed though. I will be hesitant to buy again. It makes me wonder if there aren't missing structures and supports that don't impede the assembly process. \n Category: furniture",
            "output": "True",
            "explanation": "It's the correct category. Because the customer gives a review of the product which belongs to the furniture category, which we can see it from the way the customer describes his experience sharing how he unpackaged his chair."

I had them replaced and clearly instructed the Amazon service rep to make sure the replacement locks were keyed alike. I was assured they would make sure. I'm now ordering my third set of replacement locks. Hopefully this third set will be keyed alike. Hate to give a low star rating as the locks seem very solid, but Amazon and it's third party sellers need to improve their communication. Once I receive a set that is keyed alike I will change the rating to reflect the lock quality. \n Category: home_improvement",

Playing anything becomes impossible when about half your notes don't register. It appears to be very cheaply made. Amazon refuses to return due to health and safety issues.

I should have looked closer at the measurements because I was looking for something thicker that could hold more than one checkbook. The pockets are too small for that. This is great if you want to store a lot of cards, cash and ONE checkbook. My reason for the negative review is they dont allow returns. I am a bit of a power user when it comes to Amazon and have been using it heavily for something like 10 years. I have NEVER come across a product/seller that didn't allow returns. \n Category: apparel",
