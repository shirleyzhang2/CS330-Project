        "In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into one of two classes: agree or disagree. Classify the comment as disagree if it is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement, whether healthy or unhealthy. The disagreement can be due to toxic content (for example, disrespect, identity attack, insult, and threat), controversial content, misunderstandings, or conflicting opinions. Classify the comment as agree otherwise."

            "input": "Comment: Why do right wingers have so little respect for the rule of law when the law does not advance their personal interests?  Is it a lack of empathy?  Or a more general lack of basic human decency?  I don't doubt that pBurns9 would be the first one to run to the courts if his rights were violated.",
            "output": "Disagree",
            "explanation": "This comment expresses strong disagreement with right-wing politics, is disrespectful (accusing right-wingers \"lack of basic human decency\"), and comes with personal attack (to the user pBurns9). Thus, this comment is likely to raise a certain level of public disagreement from others."

            "input": "Comment: So, was there no other evidence? What about the victim statement? There was apparently enough to keep this person locked up awaiting trial for rape. What happened to the evidence that put him in jail? It did not just go away because the victim died? Surely we can do better in terms of both the memory of the victim as well as other potential victims.",
            "output": "Agree",
            "explanation": "The comment questions the justice process concerning a rape case. It is not disrespectful and expresses a reasonable criticism. The comment is unlikely to raise wide public disagreement."

A person simply has to walk across the longest undefended border in the world anywhere other than at an official crossing. Are we promptly returning them to the US? To Haiti? I doubt it. \n\nAll over the world we are seeing people on the move from poor countries to wealthier countries. This is only the start. Our geography has been the biggest factor in preventing Canada from experiencing the same overwhelming flood of migration as in Europe. \n\nAnyone who raises an objection is quickly labelled a racist, but this really is something we should have a National conversation about.",

But I am still going to come out here and make my case.\" \n_____________________________\n\nThe fact that the Alberta Premier acknowledges that BCers have to be \"stood up for\" because the Alberta Premier is lobbying for an American-owned Company on behalf of giving raw assets to China, is the most disturbing part of this ordeal. \n\nThis is NOT for Canada or for Canadians and even trying to bully BC to be destroyed for a Chinese market and for American companies to profit on that is treason and IRRESPONSIBLE + RECKLESS.\n\nRaise your royalty rates in Alberta on the projects YOU ALREADY HAVE and create jobs cleaning up all the oil sludge spills THAT YOU CURRENTLY have. Tax the foreign-owned head offices in Calgary and send the temporary foreign workers home, do not extort BC and do not endanger OUR LIVES for TOXIC SLUDGE.",

Because the assailants were immigrants, the police and media both covered up the incident for several days.\n\nNot good; and the look-the-other-way attitude of the elites does nothing to help the cause of the honest, forthright immigrants who integrate into their new society and eventually become part of its bedrock.",

The fact of the matter is that the very same Republican led Government that squandered our oil revenue, and placed the state in this position, did so fully intending to try and get their greedy hands on the PFD. There has been no real effort to correct the give away of Alaska's money to non-producing oil companies. This gave them what they have been looking for for years, a way to get at the PFD. Demand side economics says that the more disposable income that each individual household has , the healthier the overall economy will be. Pushing the supply side agenda simply moves the money to the top so it can \"trickle down \". It is a scam plain and simple. The only accomplishment will be the theft, once again, of millions of dollars from state residents. Greed motivates this sham of a state Government, and not the economy.",

I applaud the lady who had the guts to speak up about, most especially because she is not 'white.'.     \n\nDisgusting use of my tax dollars.  I have no kids but if I did you can be assured I would be going into the classroom removing my kid while politely denouncing this curriculum as the reverse racism it is.  All the while telling the innocent and beautiful children that we are all equal and deserving of respect and should offer compassion for each other.   \n\nAs for grocery stores, when the demand is there they supply it.  I noticed in my city there has been a real uptick in cultural offerings.  I think that is great, but I had no idea we were supposed to pander to such nonsense.   Why well intentioned dolts always seem to make matters worse is beyond me.",

Kerry is a fool as Obama used him on this one, and today on the Russian hacking stuff.  Odd that both of these thing took 8 years for Obama to act.  Obama's real legacy will be that he was the President that created Donald Trump.  LOL!",

It's not unique). See a November, 15, 2016 Globe article entitled  \"Canadian universities search for balance in accepting corporate money\" for more. So much for Canadian U's being leftist bastions fomenting and fermenting socialist revolution. The corporate capitalists are taking over Universities, not the Marxists.",
