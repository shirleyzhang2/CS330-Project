        "You will be given a context and a verb, separated by a newline character. You need to identify if the given verb implies an opinion, an intention, or a wish. A verb refers to an intention only if it refers to an event planned to happen in the future and is not conditional (or part of a condition). If the verb refers to an opinion, an intention, or a wish, output 'Yes'. Otherwise, output 'No'."
