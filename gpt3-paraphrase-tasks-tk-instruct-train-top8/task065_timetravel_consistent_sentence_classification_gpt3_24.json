        "In this task, you will be given a short story consisting of 5 sentences, with the second sentence missing. You will then be given 2 options to choose from, and you will need to select the one that best connects the first sentence with the rest of the story. Indicate your answer by 'Option 1' if the first option is correct, otherwise 'Option 2'. The incorrect option will change the subsequent storyline, so that at least one of the three subsequent sentences is no longer consistent with the story."
