            "input": "Paragraph: While the financial costs of screening mammography&!1-positive recalls&biopsies were not included in the study,readers would benefit from being reminded that recall mammography&biopsies increase patient financial costs.This article leads with valuable information for all women over age 40 by stating \u201cGetting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a!1 alarm,a new study shows.\u201d Unfortunately the writer doesn\u2019t quantify or elaborate adequately on that reduction.Instead,the writer later focuses on how women undergoing screening mammography shouldn\u2019t be anxious if they experience a recall because over half of women who have screening mammograms for 10 years will be recalled.Readers would have been better served if the writer had emphasized the significant reduction in both recall mammograms&!1-positive biopsies in women who are screened every two years rather than annually.Part of the continuing controversy over screening mammography focuses on annual versus biennial screening.Because this study showed a significant reduction in the percentage of those recalled&needing biopsies among women who are screened every other year,with no statistically significant increase in late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer,the article should have emphasized those important findings.The piece states that the researchers noted that \u201c\u2026!1 positive recalls may cause inconvenience&anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring.\u201d This article fails to include several important facts about the study.1)This is a prospective cohort study of women screened between 1994-2006.2)Most of the mammograms were film rather than digital.3)Few women underwent screening for the entire 10 year period.4)Screening mammography recall rates are influenced by the skill of the radiologists who read the mammograms.There was no disease mongering.No independent experts were quoted.The story did an adequate job comparing \u2013 at a very high level \u2013 annual screening versus biennial screening.Screening mammography is widely available throughout the United States.The study did not examine a new procedure.There\u2019s no evidence that the story relied solely on a news release. \nClaim: Annual Mammograms May Have More False-Positives",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This article reports on the results of a study of nearly 170,0 women who had screening mammograms beginning between age 40-59.The study found that over ten years of screening mammograms,over half of the women will experience a!1-positive recall for additional mammography.In addition,7%-9%of the women will have a biopsy for a suspicious lump which is not cancerous.Both of those percentages decrease if the woman is screened every other year rather than every year.Even with biennial mammography,41%of women will experience a recall over 10 years of mammography.The study\u2019s Principal Investigator emphasized that \u201cin most cases,a recall doesn\u2019t mean you have cancer.\u201d She hoped this knowledge would reduce the anxiety of women who are recalled.The story never explained the size of the decrease in the number of!1 positives between annual(61.3%) and biennial screening(41.6%).Our first two reviewers were a researcher who specializes in health decisions and a breast cancer survivor trained in evidence by the Natiional Breast Cancer Coalition\u2019s Project LEAD.This study is valuable because it helps to quantify and compare the harms of annual and biennial screening,specifically the number of!1 positives and the number of unnecessary biopsies.Prior to this study,estimates of!1 positive screening mammography rates varied widely.The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening,subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of \u201cearly stage\u201d cancer.This study\u2019s data seems to suggest that answer is yes."

            "input": "Paragraph: The news release quotes lead researcher Robert Meier,MD,saying previous studies have shown SBRT to be \u201ca cost-effective and faster alternative to IMRT\u201d but does not provide any detail as to the specific costs of either procedure. In fact,the difference is substantial. A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined Medicare claims data showed a mean treatment cost of $13,645 for SBRT versus $21,023 for IMRT. And a 2012 study in the Journal of Oncology Practice concluded that SRBT has \u201cgreat potential cost savings\u201d for the health care system,with an average cost of $22,152 versus $35,431 for IMRT. One could also consider the cost of side effects as well as need for future treatments. The news release gives a lot of data. It states that 97 percent of patients were free from prostate cancer progression after five years,exceeding a historical control of 93 percent. It also says that fewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity. However,the news release does not attempt to say how these rates compare with other treatment options,which would help readers put the data in perspective. There are important caveats left out in the description of findings that are discussed under the evidence criterion. The news release states that between half and two-thirds of patients experienced low,\u201cusually temporary\u201d rates of toxicities. It also notes that \u201cfewer than 2 percent of patients experienced severe toxicities in their gastrointestinal,reproductive,and urinary systems,and no patients reported life-threatening or fatal toxicity.\u201d A few more details here would be helpful. For example,how many patients experienced a decline in urinary or sexual function,and for what period of time? And what are other potential risks of radiation therapy? The real question is how do these harms compare to other treatments? That was not assessed in this study. The news release gives some details to help readers understand how the study was conducted. However,it neglects to include several key points. First,the patients enrolled are from a very low risk population in terms of measuring benefit. The statement that these results compare favorably to historical controls at 5 years misses the point that the risk of death for this patient population isn\u2019t seen until 10-15 years at the earliest. Second,without a contemporaneous comparison group,it should be stated that these results are subject to misinterpretation \u2014 both in terms of benefits,which are likely to be equally good with almost any other treatment (and some would argue active surveillance without treatment),and harms. Finally,it isn\u2019t clear who this population represents. If these are younger men in their 50s and 60s,side effects are important but the long- term efficacy (beyond 5 years) is critical. If the men are over 70,one can argue whether they needed to treat the low risk group at all. In summary,this is a case series with no contemporaneous comparison group among a population with low risk prostate cancer where 5 year follow-up is inadequate to say that the treatment was successful in preventing progressive disease. The release could have included some cautions that the lead researcher discussed in a published paper in 2015. For example,he states that more radiation effects on adjacent organs might be observed after longer follow-up,and \u201cfirm conclusions about the efficacy and toxicity of SBRT relative to more conventional approaches await scrutiny by prospective randomized trials.\u201d The news release does not commit mongering. However,as noted above,the patients enrolled in the trial were a very low risk population and one could argue that some of these patients may not have needed treatment at all. The news release does not say how the study was funded or whether any of the investigators have conflicts of interest. In papers on the topic published in 2015,the researchers declared no conflicts of interest. Some of the men in the study had a low-risk form of prostate cancer,which might have made them eligible for active surveillance rather than surgery. That option is not discussed in the news release. As mentioned in the quantifying benefits section,the news release does mention that this type of radiotherapy was compared with standard radiotherapy,although it was not directly studied. The news release states that patients in the trial were treated at 21 academic,regional,and community medical centers,which suggests that SRBT is widely available. The release claims novelty with this statement:\u201cOur study is the first to contribute multi-center data that support the use of SBRT as front-line therapy for men with prostate cancer.\u201d But it also states that SRBT for prostate cancer has been studied at other institutions,and that the procedure has become a standard of care for some lung cancer cases. It does not claim that this is a novel procedure. The news release does not contain any unjustifiable or sensational language. But as noted above,the favorable results in terms of benefit are not surprising and attributing them to the treatment could be viewed as unjustified. \nClaim: SBRT Offers Prostate Cancer Patients High Cancer Control and Low Toxicity in Fewer Treatments",
            "output": "1",
            "explanation": "This news release describes five-year outcomes for 309 men with early-stage prostate cancer who received stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT),which delivers targeted doses of radiation cheaper and faster than the prevailing radiation therapy treatment for prostate cancer. The study measured the rates of severe injury to surrounding tissues and disease-free survival. The news release said it\u2019s the first large,multi- institutional study of this technology in prostate cancer with long-term follow-up,involving patients at 21 community,regional,and academic hospitals across the U.S. The release does a good job of quantifying the evidence but could have helped readers better understand the implications of the data by giving cost and safety comparisons with other radiation treatment,and by discussing limitations related to using a historical control group (rather than a contemporaneous control group) which introduces potential for bias. The release is based on a study presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) annual conference. The study abstract can be found on page 4 of this document. Prostate cancer is a commonly diagnosed condition in men that is associated with aging. Many patients don\u2019t realize that prostate cancer is not a uniformly fatal disease. For men with low risk disease,active surveillance without treatment is a viable option. Even for men with higher risk disease where treatment is warranted,one needs to follow patients for 10-15 years to identify a survival benefit from treatment. This is useful context to keep in mind when examining this new study of patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. The results present a rosy picture of SBRT,in terms of both benefits and harms. However,without a contemporaneous control group,such as those receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or even active surveillance,one cannot be sure that these favorable results are due to the treatment itself or the patients who were selected for treatment. Comparing results of individuals who are likely to live a long time with their disease to those treated at some point in the past is rife with problems and such studies,called case series,are deemed to be low on the ladder of scientific rigor. Even the low rate of complications,while very reassuring,still would benefit from a comparison to patients treated with other forms of radiation at the same time period."

            "input": "Paragraph: The story does discuss costs,but the framing is problematic. The story,based on a conversation with one source,the study\u2019s lead investigator,says,\u201cIt\u2019s difficult at this point to predict costs. However,he expects costs will not approach those for Provenge,the pricey treatment vaccine for prostate cancer approved by the FDA in 2010. Provenge costs $93,0 for the one-month,three- dose treatment. Medicare covers it.\u201d This tells readers that,no matter what the drug costs,Medicare likely will cover it. We appreciate the effort to bring cost information into the story,but this type of information is misleading. The story does explain that only one patient remains cancer free following the study. It then details how for most of the patients cancer continued to progress after 2 months. It says that the median overall survival in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer patients was less than 16 months. But the story is framed in such a way to highlight the one potentially positive outcome of the study and to downplay the negative. We read more sooner about the one patient who may have responded well to the vaccine than we do about the 25 other patients who did not. The story mentions side effects in a satisfactory way. Technically,the story provides readers with much of the information they would need to assess the validity of the study,but it comes out in bits and pieces. For example,we only find out near the end of the story that \u201cThe woman,who remains disease-free,had a previous treatment with a different treatment vaccine. \u2018That might have primed her immune system,\u2019 Gulley speculates. She also had only one regimen of chemotherapy,perhaps keeping her immune system stronger.\u201d This casts much doubt on the study\u2019s design,and it would have been nice to have seen some outside expertise brought in to either discuss those design problems or to torpedo the story altogether. Again,the story deserves high marks for being very specific in the lead and throughout the story. It says,that the vaccine is \u201cfor breast and ovarian cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\u201d in the lead and later details the particular circumstances of the study cohort. It says,\u201cThe patients had already undergone a variety of treatments but the cancer was progressing. Twenty one of the 26 had undergone three or more chemotherapy regimens.\u201d This is the root of the story\u2019s main shortcoming. Almost all of the information in the story comes from one source:Dr. James Gulley,who oversaw the study. Gulley is quite enthusiastic about this vaccine,despite the evidence,and the story needed more perspectives to put this vaccine into a broader context. At the very end,there are a few comments from Dr. Vincent K. Tuohy,who also is working on a breast cancer vaccine. Because of his competing research,he seems to have a conflict,but even putting that aside,his comments were not used to their best effect. There was no comparison in the story to existing alternatives. The median survival,for example,is presented without the context of how long these patients might have lived had they been undergoing standard chemotherapy and radiation treatments. We give high marks to the story for saying right in the lead that the findings are from \u201ca preliminary study in 26 patients.\u201d That tells readers both that the findings need to be interpreted with caution and that the treatment is not available to most people. The concept of vaccines for breast/ovarian cancer is indeed novel,and the story acknowledges that other vaccines are being studied. The story does not rely on a news release. \nClaim: Study: Vaccine for Breast, Ovarian Cancer Has Potential",
            "output": "0",
            "explanation": "While the story does many things well,the overall framing of the story is that the vaccine \u201cshows promise,\u201d when the evidence actually points in the other direction.Because only one patient in the study remains cancer free and because that patient may very well have benefited from an earlier cancer vaccine and other complicating factors,we question the decision to write this story in the first place.Right now,there more than 10,0 cancer-related clinical trials recruiting patients.Cancer has foiled scientists repeatedly with treatments that initially seemed promising in the laboratory or in a very small group of people and later proved unworkable on a larger scale.It\u2019s a difficult task \u2014 but a crucial one \u2014 for reporters to ask tough questions of the evidence and a wide range of sources before deciding whether one of these thousands of experimental treatment options merits coverage. This shows that the claim is True and the output is incorrect."

            "input": "Paragraph: There is no mention of costs in the release, but overuse of medical technology such as MRI scanning is one major reason for soaring health care costs. According to personal finance website Nerdwallet.com, median prices of a brain MRI range from $525 in Atlanta to a whopping $3,310 in Milwaukee. The main contention of the news release is that \u201cimaging findings can help spur beneficial lifestyle changes in patients to reduce risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d But there\u2019s no evidence presented to show that these images have any effect \u2014 good or bad \u2014 on patients\u2019 adoption of beneficial lifestyle changes. Does performing an MRI increase the likelihood that someone will lose weight, exercise, and stop smoking? The release also states, \u201cinstitutions\u2026 meld these approaches into novel ways to improve patient care,\u201d but the report doesn\u2019t detail what those \u201cnovel\u201d therapies are. Experts in the report talk about pinpointing \u201cvolume loss in the brain\u201d and characterizing imaging markers, but these are all surrogate endpoints. In other words, how do these translate to tangible health outcomes for patients? Bottom line: The idea that a brain MRI is going to help motivate people to adopt meaningful lifestyle changes \u2014 and that those changes will, in turn, lead to an actual reduction in the number of Alzheimer\u2019s disease cases \u2014 requires several leaps of logic that have very limited support from evidence. The release owed it to readers either to point out the preliminary nature of the hypothesis or provide some evidence to back it up. The release did neither. Procedures almost always carry risks, and MRI is no exception. Some physicians are concerned with \u201cMRI abuse,\u201d pointing out that MRIs often pick up abnormal \u2013 but harmless \u2013 findings that muddy up the clinical picture. These so-called \u201cincidentalomas\u201d can lead to more tests and treatments that cause harm and add to costs. Unnecessary imaging is a major contributor to spiraling health care costs in the US, since a single scan on average in the US costs $2,611, according to Medicare data. Beyond stating that it exists, this news release provides no information about the journal article that is the subject of the release. Nor does it detail any of the studies that supposedly support the value of imaging for Alzheimer\u2019s disease prevention. We\u2019d add that the journal article itself provides limited-quality evidence \u2014 it doesn\u2019t detail the process for selecting articles that are included in the review (raising the possibility of \u201ccherry-picked\u201d studies) and includes little in the way of critical evaluation of the studies that are cited. Strangely, three physicians, who weren\u2019t listed as authors of the study, are quoted in the release and allowed to tout the benefits of quantitative MRI technology. They make sweeping statements, such as that this technology \u201cwill have a huge impact in the future\u201d and that imaging \u201ccan have a powerful impact [on patients]\u201d But the report fails to go into detail. One of these experts adds, \u201cPatients seem to enjoy reviewing results of their imaging studies, more so than reading the results of their blood tests or other clinical evaluations.\u201d But one physician\u2019s anecdotal observation is not evidence of enhanced quality or effectiveness of care. Again, supporting data is needed. The news release does not engage in disease mongering and states that as many as three million cases of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia could be prevented with lifestyle changes. However, it does imply that there would be more cases prevented with the addition of brain imaging, a claim that is not supported by the release or the underlying review article. The release does not specify funding sources for the work, which included the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering and the National Institutes of Health. Many of the authors are consultants for medical device and pharmaceutical companies, including Toshiba (cited as \u201crelated\u201d or relevant in the original research report). The release does not disclose this. The main premise of the news release is that MRI imaging can help people lower their risks for cognitive decline by encouraging them to make lifestyle and behavioral changes. It states that risk factors include obesity, diet, sleep, hypertension, diabetes, depression and smoking. However, the release does not address any alternatives \u2014 besides brain imaging \u2014 that might help people make the desired changes. Behavioral change counseling, which is an established approach to reducing problematic behaviors, is not discussed. The release doesn\u2019t address the availability of quantitative MRIs of the brain. MRI in general has been used since the 1970s, and its availability is not in question. But since the issue is not specifically addressed by the release, we\u2019ll rate it Not Applicable. Using quantitative MRI technology to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s disease in its early stages is not a new concept. There have been blog posts and numerous studies in the past 10 years devoted to this topic. We\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s new here. The news release refers to \u201cnovel ways to improve patient care,\u201d but does not specify what these new approaches are. The language of the release bordered on sensational, with neurologist Majid Fotuhi touting the benefits of quantitative MRI technology and claiming it will have a \u201chuge impact in the future of diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d The release never clarifies the how and why of this statement.

Instead by saying, \u201ccould be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years\u2019 time\u201d it leaves readers with the impression that cost is not an issue. This is exactly the kind of device that an insurance company might put on its \u201cineligible\u201d list. A quick review of the business media suggests the cost of the device will exceed $75,000 if it becomes commercially available. according to this Medical Device Technology Alert. It is hard to imagine why this important fact was overlooked in the story. Beyond saying in the lead that three people were able to \u201csee shapes and objects,\u201d there is not much else in the story to help readers understand the levels of vision improvements that were seen and how those should be compared to the preexisting conditions or other treatments. Then, confusingly, the story narrows its focus to just one patient saying, \u201cone blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently. He could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.\u201d It\u2019s tough when writing a story about a study this small to put hard numbers to the benefits, but even some acknowledgment of this limitation would have been better than some of the overly optimistic sentiments expressed. The study itself and the press released provided more ways for the story to quantify the benefits. The story provides absolutely no information on the implant requirements for the device\u00a0nor the potential downsides associated with this surgical procedure. There are some caveats tossed into this story, but they can\u2019t overcome the hype. The story says in the lead that\u00a0the implant \u201callowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment\u201d. The next sentence says,\u00a0\u201cExperts described the study results as phenomenal\u201d. The story does deserve credit for saying in the lead that only \u201cthree blind patients\u201d saw vision improvement, but the story does little else to describe the limitations of the study or to place it in any context. The story engages in disease mongering\u00a0by throwing in some sketchy numbers about the frequency of the disease. It says the device \u201ccould eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.\u201d Later it says, \u201cRetinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.\u201d By our math, 200,000 out of 6.8 billion people worldwide means that 1 out of every 34,500 people is affected. And if we\u2019re just talking about adults, that number drops to 1 out of every 22,105 people, a far cry from 1 out of every 4,000. If it were truly one out of every 4,000 people worldwide, that would mean that 1.1 million people have the disease. The story does quote one presumed independent source, Robert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain\u2019s Oxford University. In the above mentioned Medical Technology Alert, the manufacturer announced that Dr. Maclaren will be the lead investigator on a clinical study expected to enroll\u00a0six subjects to advance this same retinal implant technology. As a result, Dr. Maclaren can hardly be described as an independent expert. Overall, we felt that the story was missing a strong, independent analysis. Had the reporter talked with more researchers in the field or more clinicians, perhaps the story would have had a more thoughtful tone. The story mentions that there are other implants, saying, \u201cOther types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.\u201d But that\u2019s not a true comparison, nor does it provide readers with the true picture of how much R&D is happening right now in this field. As is often the case in medicine, surgical options and devices are not the only solution. Lowly old Vitamin A is often the first step for treating retinitis pigmentosa. The story does a credible job noting that the device is under study and not commercially available. Unfortunately it also suggests, based on the manufacturer\u2019s statement, that the device in a very early stage of development will be available in 5 years. The hyperbole used is indefensible \u2013 \u201cthe device could become routine for some kinds of blindness in five years\u201d\u00a0and \u201ccould eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide.\u201d\u00a0 This comes after a test in 3 people. The novelty of the device is established. The story does not rely on\u00a0a news release, and, in fact, this news release from the University of Tubingen contains more interesting information about the study than the story.

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes Nearly half of adult Brazilians are overweight and about 15 percent are obese, Brazil\u2019s IBGE social statistics agency said on Friday, citing the results of a national study carried out with the Health Ministry. Among 20- to 24-year-olds, the percentage of men who were overweight jumped to 50.1 percent from 18.5 percent in a survey carried out in 1974, while the percentage of overweight women rose to 48 percent from 28.7 percent. \u201cWe are in a situation of absolute red alert,\u201d Brazil\u2019s Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao told reporters in beach-side Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIf we stay at this pace, in 10 years we will have two-third of the population overweight (or obese), as has happened in the United States.\u201d   Incomes in Brazil have been rising rapidly in recent years as Latin America\u2019s largest country enjoys a prolonged economic boom that has lifted millions out of poverty.

And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that.\"\" \"\"People should know the facts,\"\" she added. The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus. But the name of the disease doesn\u2019t mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit. COVID-19 is short for \"\"coronavirus disease 2019,\"\" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified. The WHO announced the name on Feb. 11. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"\"CO\"\" stands for \"\"corona,\"\" \"\"VI\"\" stands for \"\"virus,\"\" and \"\"D\"\" stands for \"\"disease.\"\" Before the WHO formalized a name for the disease, it was referred to as the \"\"2019 novel coronavirus\"\" or \"\"2019-nCoV.\"\" The virus itself, by contrast, is known as \"\"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\"\" and abbreviated as \"\"SARS-CoV-2,\"\" according to the WHO. The CDC lists seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, some of which are relatively common. Conway was clearer about the origins of \"\"COVID-19\"\" during a separate interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo roughly 30 minutes after her comment on \"\"Fox & Friends.\"\" \"\"It\u2019s called COVID-19 because that\u2019s the year, that\u2019s the year,\"\" Conway said while ripping the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. \"\"It\u2019s not COVID-20. It\u2019s COVID-19.\"\" Facing blowback for her \"\"Fox & Friends\"\" comment, Conway tweeted the clip from her interview with Bartiromo. She said she knows \"\"19 refers to (the) year,\"\" but that she was making the point that the WHO \"\"should see pandemics coming\"\" because of the funding it gets from the U.S.  Dear @RepBobbyRush: I know 19 refers to year.

Conway was addressing \"\"the sheer number of years the U.S. has given billions and billions of dollars to WHO and were failed by them,\"\" the White House said, adding that in each of her April 15 interviews, she said the WHO\u2019s job is to anticipate infectious disease pandemics. \"\"Kellyanne never mentioned \u201818 other coronaviruses,\u2019\"\" the White House said. Conway said, \"\"This is COVID-19, not COVID-1,\"\" arguing that the WHO should have been better prepared to deal with the virus. \"\"People should know the facts,\"\" she added. We agree. The name of the disease caused by the coronavirus, COVID-19, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the 19th in a series of similar coronaviruses. The 19 refers to the year it was discovered, 2019.

            "input": "Paragraph: \"Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure. But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion. \"\"When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010,\"\" he says on his official congressional website. \"\"Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011.\"\" Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009. When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million. That\u2019s a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited. But it\u2019s only part of the story. First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or \"\"saved\"\" as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources. The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally. But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, \"\"do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the law\u2019s impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower...\"\"  Among the reasons is that \"\"some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus,\"\" and that the reports do not \"\"attempt to measure\"\" the number of indirect jobs. Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the law\u2019s impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why. \"\"Evaluating the impact,\"\" said the report, which was the sixth in a series, \"\" \u2026 is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy.\"\" Separately, the council\u2019s report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. Oregon\u2019s acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics. \"\"This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get,\"\" he said. He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011. Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011. Economists say there\u2019s another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that aren\u2019t touched by the stimulus. There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel. The White House and supporters factor those \"\"saved\"\" jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not. Got it? It\u2019s all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true. But Walden\u2019s context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say it\u2019s impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were \"\"created or saved,\"\" as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And it\u2019s clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus. Walden\u2019s assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details.

            "input": "Paragraph: \"On May 14, 2013, a federal agency recommended reducing the threshold for evidence of drunken driving from a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 to 0.05. That means having a glass of wine at dinner might make a person drunk, a spokesman for the Tavern League of Wisconsin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the same day. Under a BAC standard of 0.05, a person could get nailed for DUI after one drink? Tavern League\u2019s evidence The statement was made by Scott Stenger, a Madison lobbyist whose clients include the tavern league. He told us he based his claim on news articles about the 0.05 recommendation, including a report from the Journal Sentinel and The Associated Press, and a chart on blood-alcohol concentration from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. The news covered the recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents and makes recommendations based on its findings. The board said states should cut the current blood-alcohol level for evidence of intoxication as part of a series of ideas aimed at reducing alcohol-related highway deaths. In its report, the Associated Press said 0.05 is \"\"about one drink for a woman weighing less than 120 pounds,\"\" and that a drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of 80-proof alcohol \"\"in most studies.\"\" Meanwhile, the Texas agency chart that Stenger cited says its BAC data comes from another federal body, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which works to prevent highway crashes. That data says essentially what Stenger and AP did: A 100-pound woman could reach 0.05 after one drink. (Incidentally, both the AP and the chart used by the Texas agency said a 160-pound man could reach 0.05 after consuming two drinks in one hour.) So, there\u2019s evidence that a limited group of drinkers -- women weighing under 120 pounds -- could be legally drunk after one drink, if the standard for drunken driving were reduced to a blood-alcohol level of 0.05. What other evidence is out there? BAC calculators We checked three online calculators that provide blood-alcohol concentration estimates based on various factors, including gender and weight. They generally found a BAC of less than 0.05 for a 100-pound woman consuming one drink. The calculator at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (which also has a smartphone app), says the BAC would be 0.03. A more detailed calculator from the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.04 for a 5-ounce glass of wine, if the wine is red and 12.5 percent alcohol. And the calculator at Central Connecticut State University\u2019s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.05 after a 5-ounce glass of table wine. So, why do the blood-alcohol concentration figures vary? Well, as we noted, all of the figures are estimates. The Wisconsin DOT also points out that besides gender, weight and the amount of alcohol consumed, other factors are in play. Your BAC will be higher if you drink faster or drink on an empty stomach. Women reach higher BACs faster because they have less water in their bodies and more adipose tissue (fat), which is not easily penetrated by alcohol. Jan Grebel, a chemical test supervisor for the DOT, told us about another factor: If you drink frequently, your liver can break down alcohol more efficiently, but if you don\u2019t, your BAC would be higher after even one drink. Grebel quoted to us from a chart she utilizes when testifying in court in drunken driving cases. She said the chart estimates the BAC at 0.047 -- nearly 0.05 -- for a 100-pound woman after one drink. But Grebel said that would be the maximum BAC in that instance. Most people would not reach 0.05 after one drink, she said. Our rating The Tavern League of Wisconsin said a proposal to make 0.05 the standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. The statement is accurate, in that it\u2019s possible an individual could reach 0.05 after one drink. But it needs additional information, namely that the situation would apply only in a small number of instances and would depend on other factors, such as drinking on an empty stomach.\" Claim: A 0.05 standard for drunken driving means having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk.",
