I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

            "explanation": "The answer 'housing' is correct because a house is being talked about which is indicated by the mention of 'bedrooms' and 'amenities' which are words that are both related to housing."

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

Well I could use it. I need some of the parts. Is the price negotiable?\nBuyer: I understand. Is the battery included?

What about the charger?\nBuyer: Nice. Well then I would like to offer you $200. I could pick it up today.\nSeller: I could do 230 for it.\nBuyer: That's a little steep for me.

Do they open and close easily or do you need that \"extra push\" to deal with it?\nSeller: Oh she didn't use the drawers at all, so I'm confident that you could slide them in and out nicely\nBuyer: Great. The price is way too high for me. can we negotiate on that?\nSeller: Yeah, what's your budget? I can't really go lower than 45 because of the chair that's included\nBuyer: Well what if I don't want the chair, can you just give me the table for #36?\nSeller: Oh, you don't want the chair?

Other than that, it is in sound, working condition. \nBuyer: That's great, how old is it?\nSeller: I have owned it for year. The owner before me bought it brand new. It is twenty years old. \nBuyer: Ok this all sounds fine, but do you think you could come down to about $45?\nSeller: I really cannot. I put original handlebars on it and new fenders, each easily cost more than $45 each. I could go down to $65, but that is about it. It is a great piece and needs a home to be used in!\nBuyer: That is fair.\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"
