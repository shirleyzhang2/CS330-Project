A 12 pack will seem like there's a shortage of caramels in the world. LOL.  I tried to come up with a way to explain the most awesome flavor in the world and I just can't.  To me it's like eating anything and everything in the world you ate that made you feel like \"Ahhh, that's it.\"  I can only hope that the gubment doesn't put a tax on it like cigs because then I'd have to put myself into an institution. \n Polarity: Positive",

Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.  Note that the \"Zuke's Jerky Naturals\" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog. \n Polarity: Negative",
