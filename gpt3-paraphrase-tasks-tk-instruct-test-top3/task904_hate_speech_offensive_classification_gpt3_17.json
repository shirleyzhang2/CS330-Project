        "The tweet will be one of the following three categories: (1) 'Hate Speech', (2) 'Offensive', or (3) 'Neither'. 'Hate Speech' is a threatening statement or sometimes includes a call for violence. 'Offensive' statements are simply offensive. 'Neither' is when it doesn't fall into either the Hate Speech or Offensive category."
