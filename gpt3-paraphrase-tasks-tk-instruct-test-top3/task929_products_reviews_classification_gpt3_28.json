Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

When we opened the box, there were two power cords missing, as well as several other pieces not needed to start up or watch TV. We contacted Amazon and they sent another set immediately. Unfortunately, when I plugged in the TV, we immediately got lines across the screen every couple of seconds. It looked like there was debris inside causing interference between light frequencies bouncing off parts of the screen.",

If you hit pause, it does not let go until the song has been played 5 times. Often when I'm sitting in my car listening to music and I stop because it's time out, or whatever reason- there are times that the screen says \"error\" and continues the track.",
