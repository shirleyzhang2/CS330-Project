            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

I'm a fan now, too.Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The person believes that the place is no longer the cool place it once was and also adds to it by calling this place the worst. Hence, it's negative."

        {
            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "input": "The food is always great here. The service from both the manager as well as the staff is super. Only draw back of this restaurant is it's super loud. If you can, snag a patio table!",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

Se habla espanol, and they understand spanglish pretty well too if you need help ordering.  The tacos are really delicious, asada, pollo, al pastor...you can't lose.  However, the real score is in the tortas.  If you want a bad ass sandwich, get to El Primo as fast as you can.  The bread they use for the tortas is the best bread I have ever eaten.  If Subway had bread half this good they would be running the New World Order by now. South Austin diamond in the rough.",

I think its time to hyper-freshen or just  retire this no-longer-Nuevo factory.     Not going to wait for an attitude adjustment in this restaurant buzzing city.
