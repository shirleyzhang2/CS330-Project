Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

            "input": "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

            "input": "As next-generation sequencing (NGS) becomes a major sequencing platform in clinical diagnostic laboratories, it is critical to identify artifacts that constitute baseline noise and may interfere with detection of low-level gene mutations. This is especially critical for applications requiring ultrasensitive detection, such as molecular relapse of solid tumors and early detection of cancer. We recently observed a ~10-fold higher frequency of C:G\\xa0>\\xa0T:A mutations than the background noise level in both wild-type peripheral blood and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. We hypothesized that these might represent cytosine deamination events, which have been seen using other platforms.', 'To test this hypothesis, we pretreated samples with uracil N-glycosylase (UNG). Additionally, to test whether some of the cytosine deamination might be a laboratory artifact, we simulated the heat associated with polymerase chain reaction thermocycling by subjecting samples to thermocycling in the absence of polymerase. To test the safety of universal UNG pretreatment, we tested known positive samples treated with UNG.', 'UNG pretreatment significantly reduced the frequencies of these mutations, consistent with a biologic source of cytosine deamination. The simulated thermocycling-heated samples demonstrated significantly increased frequencies of C:G\\xa0>\\xa0T:A mutations without other baseline base substitutions being affected. Samples with known mutations demonstrated no decrease in our ability to detect these after treatment with UNG.",

            "input": "Exogenously administered biglycan (core protein with high-molecular weight glycosaminoglycan chains) has been shown to protect neonatal cardiomyocytes against simulated ischemia/reperfusion injury (SI/R), however, the mechanism of action is not clear. In this study we aimed to investigate, which structural component of biglycan is responsible for its cardiocytoprotective effect and to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the cytoprotection.', 'A pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that both native (glycanated) and deglycanated biglycan can attenuate cell death induced by SI/R in a dose-dependent manner in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes isolated from Wistar rats. In separate experiments, we have shown that similarly to glycanated biglycan, recombinant human biglycan core protein (rhBGNc) protects cardiomyocytes against SI/R injury. In contrast, the glycosaminoglycan component dermatan sulfate had no significant effect on cell viability, while chondroitin sulfate further enhanced cell death induced by SI/R. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc reverses the effect of SI/R upon markers of necrosis, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and autophagy. We have also shown that pharmacological blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling or its downstream mediators (IRAK1/4, ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases) abolished the cytoprotective effect of rhBGNc against SI/R injury. Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with rhBGNc for 20h resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation and NO production without having significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2, STAT3, and on the production of superoxide. Treatment over 10min and 1h with rhBGNc increased ERK1 phosphorylation, while the SI/R-induced increase in superoxide production was attenuated by rhBGNc. Blockade of NO synthesis also prevented the cardiocytoprotective effect of rhBGNc.",

The effects of estrogen in preeclampsia are normally mediated by the classical estrogen receptors. Intriguingly, a novel estrogen receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), has been recently found to play an important role in several estrogenic effects. However, the mechanisms by which GPR30 may mediate the development of preeclampsia remain unknown.', 'We observed that the expression of GPR30 in placental trophoblast cells is lower in preeclamptic placentas compared with normotensive controls. We then investigated the role of GPR30 in trophoblast cell invasion by utilizing placental explants and the immortalized human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo).', 'The selective GPR30 agonist G1 and a general estrogen receptors agonist 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E2) both improved trophoblast cells invasion by upregulating MMP9 expression and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This effect was abolished by a selective GPR30 inhibitor G15, implying that GPR30 may be involved in regulating trophoblast invasion, and that down-regulation of this receptor may result in the development of preeclampsia.",
