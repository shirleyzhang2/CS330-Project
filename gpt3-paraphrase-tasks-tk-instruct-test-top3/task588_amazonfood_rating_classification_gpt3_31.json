But, I just recently opened a box and, after one telltale bite, I was disappointed to find that they now add autolyzed yeast extract, a common favor enhancer that is practically the same as MSG.  I have adverse reactions to both MSG and autolyzed yeast extract. Too bad they ruined this product for me and other MSG-sensitive folks out there.  I wonder why they did it?!",
