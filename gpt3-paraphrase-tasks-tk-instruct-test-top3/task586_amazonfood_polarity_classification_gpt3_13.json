In the past I have had serious sinus headaches.  After drinking this tea, my headaches were gone and the clicking in my nostril had ceased! I was so relieved! I have recently drank this tea for a dry cough! Big mistake, it gave me a sore throat as well as other issues.  I will never drink it for the common cold symptoms!  Love this product though!",
