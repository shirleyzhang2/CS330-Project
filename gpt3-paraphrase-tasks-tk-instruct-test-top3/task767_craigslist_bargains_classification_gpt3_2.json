I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

What kind of condition is it in and does it have any mechanical problems?\nSeller: It's in really great condition. It has 106k miles but these are mostly highway miles so the engine runs like it's lower miles than that.\nBuyer: Okay then. The price is a little high are you willing to negotiate?\nSeller: I can negotiate a little bit but that's really a pretty reasonable price already. What were you thinking?\nBuyer: Are you willing to go down to 8000?\nSeller: No that is way too low, it's worth much more than that. How about 13500? \nBuyer: That is too high. I don't think it's worth that much given the mileage. How about 10500\nSeller: Since the engine is in really good condition that would really be too low. 12500 is the lowest I can go.\nBuyer: Okay that sounds fair.\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

Also it is only slightly used as my child who I orignally bought it for hit a growth spurt shortly after.\nBuyer: Does it have any issues? Flat tires, faulty brakes etc?\nSeller: No there are no such issues I had sprayed the exposed metal parts with anti rust. Therefore the brakes still function smoothly. As for tires I had recently ensured to inflate back to the appropriate tire pressure.\nBuyer: Would you take $70\nSeller: That would be a little too low for me. Ihad previoulsy paid around 200 for it brand new so 70 would put me at quite a loss. I could throw in a bicyle bell if that would intrest you.\nBuyer: What about $80 and I'll pick it up?\nSeller: Would you still want the bell in this case?\nBuyer: No.\nSeller: Then that would be fine I could also meet you half way if necessary.\nBuyer: Perfect\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"
