    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will be given two words, and you need to predict the preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should be one that explicitly conveys the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the preposition should be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
