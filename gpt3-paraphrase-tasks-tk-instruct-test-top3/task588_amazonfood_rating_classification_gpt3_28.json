I'm OK with a more medium roast, but this coffee seems more mild then I would have expected. Still a good deal, but I wish it had more flavor. In general, I've had good luck with Jeremiah's brand, although sometimes the bags are not as well-sealed as they should be.",

So if you love the smell of truffles, then you'll probably like this product.  My gripe is with the labeling.  It makes it seem as if real truffles are somehow involved with this product, they are not.  If you look at the ingredients, there are two:  olive oil and white truffle aroma.  Well truffle aroma is just 2,4-Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.  So buyer beware, it tastes and smells great, but this is not a real truffle product.",
