Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

            "input": "This is by far the worst product I've purchased from Amazon. It's absolutely impossible to apply bubble free using any of these products: &#62; Bubbles, dust particles and fingerprints. The plastic tabs leave behind adhesive residue so there are tons that you can't remove. It took me 3 tries before I got one on with minimal bubbles to try peeling off because of its adhesive. Finally, after trying for 15 minutes, the rest had air bubbles. So it left my hands covered in dust. I'm going back tomorrow.",

To add insult to injury when trying to move from one menu to another you had to exit and start again as most of these menus took up two spaces just like every other movie i see now. I'm sorry but this wasn't worth downloading for free at all since i'm not sure if its free.",
