        "This task requires you to read a story and classify it as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. An 'imagined' story is one that is made up by the person who wrote it, pretending they experienced it. A 'recalled' story is one that the writer really experienced and is recalling from memory. A 'retold' story is one that is based on a real memory, but is written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, 'recalled' stories and 'retold' stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. 'Imagined' stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas 'recalled' stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in 'imagined' stories. Between 'recalled' and 'retold' stories, 'retold' stories flow significantly more linearly than 'recalled' stories, and 'retold' stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

As far as the axe, I hadn't used one before. So I needed to, or else I would starve. And freeze at night. So after learning the basics I felt everything went smoothly.

            "input": "I work for Walmart, a company I have been working for the past 3 years. Two weeks ago, I got a promotion. This promotion I had been waiting and hoping for, for the last year. I was finally promoted to Assistant Manager. It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July. It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early. I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines. At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did. I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager. I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before. I like to do well in the goals and tasks that I have set for myself on a daily basis when it comes to my job, or anything that I do. I am very grateful for this opportunity to be in this new position and so grateful to my employers above me that felt that I deserved this opportunity and are wanting me to progress and grow along side the company. I have put so much time and effort into this place and it's starting to pay off. I know that if I put in the amount of hours, work, and dedication that I can achieve anything and for that I am so proud and honor to be apart of this establishment. I am over the moon about this promotion and I ended up celebrating with my loved ones and family members with a bottle of bubbly berry juice (as I and my family members are not a fan of alcoholic beverages) and we went out to dinner afterwards to celebrate this new chapter of my life.",
