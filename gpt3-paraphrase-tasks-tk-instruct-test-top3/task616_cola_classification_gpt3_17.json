        "Given a sentence, classify whether the sentence is acceptable or not. A sentence is acceptable if it is grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence is acceptable, then write \"acceptable\", otherwise write \"unacceptable\"."
