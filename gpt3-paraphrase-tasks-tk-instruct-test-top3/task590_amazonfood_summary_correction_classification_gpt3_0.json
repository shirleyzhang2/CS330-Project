I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog-- she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked!  I was pretty surprised it took that little to break it.  The crack was on the screw-in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom broke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry!
