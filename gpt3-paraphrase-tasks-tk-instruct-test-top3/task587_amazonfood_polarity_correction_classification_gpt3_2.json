            "input": "While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.  While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you. \n Polarity: Negative",
