Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess \"to each his own\" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)",
