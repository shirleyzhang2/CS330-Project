    "Definition": [
        "You will receive a sentence. You need to determine if the sentence is acceptable or not by the following criteria: grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker, and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence meets all of these criteria, then it is acceptable. Otherwise, it is unacceptable."
