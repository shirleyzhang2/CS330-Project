        "Given a tweet, you are to classify it into one of the three categories: (1) 'Hate Speech', (2) 'Offensive', or (3) 'Neither'. 'Hate Speech' refers to a threatening statement or a statement that includes a call for violence. 'Offensive' refers to a statement that offends someone. 'Neither' is when the statement does not fall into either the 'Hate Speech' or 'Offensive' category."
