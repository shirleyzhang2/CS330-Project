I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

I had the lampshade made out of a scarf I bought on a cruise. The lamp itself is less than 3 months old.\nBuyer: that sounds lovely but I am on a budget. I was hoping we could negotiate the price down.\nSeller: I'd be willing to take $60 but I'd have to take the lightbulbs out and replace them with basic bulbs,\nBuyer: Could we do 55?\nSeller: sure\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

So have you used the bike for a long time? \nSeller: Yes, I've had it for 2 years.\nBuyer: Is the condition good? I mean, any scratches or scraps?\nSeller: Well, I never rode it, it's a back up bike, so it's in good shape.\nBuyer: Great. So would you accept $1840 for it?\nSeller: I don't know if I could accept $1840, as I said in my listing it's worth every penny and much more.\nBuyer: So what's the last you can go?\nSeller: If you're willing to come by and pick it up, I'd let it go for $1900.\nBuyer: Sure I can do that. Its absolutely not an issue for me! I would definitely accept this offer\nSeller: Okay, great. I'll have the bike ready.\nBuyer: Thanks\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

Great for diabetics and being constipated! How about I pick that sub box up and drop off the 30 bucks with your sugar free colon cleansers...er...gummy bears? \nSeller: Okay, I guess you have a deal.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"
