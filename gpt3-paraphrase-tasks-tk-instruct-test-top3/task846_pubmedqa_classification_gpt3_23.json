            "input": "Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?\nAnswer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "The answer clearly says that ICLSs are elevated, which is exactly what the question asks. Hence, the output will be yes and it is correct."

            "input": "Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?\nAnswer: Neuronal signals via the hepatic vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and protection against obesity in HFD fed Pemt(-/-) mice.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "The answer is in accordance with the question and clearly says that neuronal signals contribute to development of steatohepatitis. Hence, the output will be yes and it is correct."

            "input": "Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?\nAnswer: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "The answer says that psammaplin (PsA) increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins, which is in accordance with the question. Hence, this output is correct."

            "explanation": "It is mentioned in the answer that a novel biologically plausible candidate (FGFR2) for birth weight centile (BWC) as identified that merits further study. This answer satisfies the question. The output should be 'yes' and hence, this is a bad example."

            "input": "Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?\nAnswer: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting). Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.",
            "output": "no",
            "explanation": "It has been written in the answer that chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer. This answers the question. The output should be 'yes' and hence, this is a bad example."

            "explanation": "The answer says that the control subjects were not validated for absence of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and comorbidity validation was not performed. This is a satisfactory response to the question. The output should be 'yes' and hence, this is a bad example. "

We found an association between POCD and both perioperative low Svo2 and postoperative ventilation time, underlining the importance of perioperative stable hemodynamics and possible fast-track protocols with short ventilation times to attenuate POCD.",
