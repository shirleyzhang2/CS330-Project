    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you are given two words, and your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should be one that explicitly conveys the meaning of both words, e.g., Word1: king Word2: fort: \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
