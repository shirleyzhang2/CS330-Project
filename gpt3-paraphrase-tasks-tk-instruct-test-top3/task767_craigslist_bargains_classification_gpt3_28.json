I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

Never used. \nBuyer: Will it work with Boost Mobile?\nSeller: It's unlocked and will work with every service provider. \nBuyer: Excellent, I think my only concern is the lack of a warranty.  Do you provide any protection?  What if it breaks within the first week or month of using it?\nSeller: Good question. It does not have a warranty, but I believe that apple-care is around $99. I could knock off a bit of the selling price so that you could purchase the apple-care. I'm looking to get this off my hands ASAP.\nBuyer: Okay, I'm comparing it to several other offers I've seen on ebay.  What about if we do $550 so that I can get that applecare warranty and I'll bring you cash today?\nSeller: That's a bit low for me. This model sells for around $1,000 if you were to purchase a new one today and the condition of this phone is completely new and untouched. What if I offered $620?\nBuyer: I'm still a little nervous that it won't work with my network, if it doesn't work with Boost will you take it back within 24 hours?\nSeller: I understand. I would definitely take it back as long as it's within a 24 hour period. You could check with your provider and get back to me. You could also do that while we're together before you even hand me the money.\nBuyer: Okay good idea, then let's meet and I'll bring the $620 and call Boost while we're together, sound good?\nSeller: You have a deal.\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"

It's very close to the UC Berkeley campus, and to lots of transit and entertainment options even if you're not a student or faculty. The asking price is $2200.\nBuyer: But what is the neighborhood like?\nSeller: It's near campus, and many of the people living in the neighborhood go to Berkeley or teach there. It's also full of things to do and see.\nBuyer: What is the lease agreement you are thinking of\nSeller: Open to different types of lease agreements if there's something you're looking for. But our standard is a month to month lease with one month's rent as deposit.\nBuyer: Hmmm.  No credit check?  How about $1600 a month?\nSeller: $1600 is fine for a deposit, and we're happy to pick you up for a tour of the unit. We generally don't fool with credit checks, especially on month to month leases.\nBuyer: Alright, I think I can come in later today\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"
