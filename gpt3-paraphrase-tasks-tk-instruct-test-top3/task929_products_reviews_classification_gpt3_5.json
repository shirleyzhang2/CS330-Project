Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Also, it takes me only second to put down the kindle when leaving or going out which comes in handy since its always on me, so now no more wondering what I'm holding all over me. No problem closing up either. Great product. And Amazon shipped lightning fast! Definitely suggest buying this!",

But a part way through, the storyline went south for me. The ending left too many unanswered questions. If you are looking something good in this genre, and need a movie that can suck out all tension, watch this. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",

After only two weeks, one glass had already broken and since it's not being thrown around, I don't think I'll be getting another set. It's too bad! They are so pretty, but, because of poor quality, they're just fine for everyday wear.",
