        "In this task, you will be given a text from a social media post. Your task is to classify the given post into two categories: 1) yes if the given post is intentionally offensive, or 2) no, if the given post is not intentionally offensive. Also, generate label 'no' for offensive statements that appear to be unintentional, or non-offensive statements that are underhandedly offensive."
