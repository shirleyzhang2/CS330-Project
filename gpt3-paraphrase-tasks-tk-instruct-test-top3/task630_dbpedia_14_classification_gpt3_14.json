        "In this task, you're given a text which is the body of a document and a title which is the title of the document. Here the title is present in the document and it is the entity which is referred in the document. The title might have some text in parentheses, for example: \"HMS Mallow (K81)\", or be slightly different from what is present in the text. If they still refer to the same entity, then it is a correct title. Indicate your answer as \"Yes\" if the title is correct, otherwise indicate your answer as \"No\". Do not generate anything else apart from \"Yes\" or \"No\"."
