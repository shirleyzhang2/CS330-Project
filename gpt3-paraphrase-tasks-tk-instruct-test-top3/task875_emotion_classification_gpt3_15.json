            "output": "love",

            "explanation": "This statement clearly indicates joy, but the joy particularly relates to romance. So, the correct label must be \"love\" instead."

            "explanation": "Since the author feels that he must find a purpose for the suffering, the sentence has a negative outlook. So, the label should be \"sadness\" and not \"love\"."
