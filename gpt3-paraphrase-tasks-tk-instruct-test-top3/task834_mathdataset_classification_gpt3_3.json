        "In this task, you are given a math question at a high school level, and you must identify which of the five following categories it falls into: (1) algebra, (2) arithmetic, (3) measurement, (4) numbers, or (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question can only belong to one category."
