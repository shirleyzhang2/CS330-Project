I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

Further got attracted by this iphone.\nSeller: No.  I'm sorry there is no way I can take 50 for it.  \nBuyer: can you elaborate the other features this iphone has..?\nSeller: You do see, correct that these are two phones?  One is iphone 5 and other 4.  What specific features are you looking for?  They are iphones, so do pretty much everything.\nBuyer: are you sure that the physical damage is a minor one..? whether it will affect the performance?\nSeller: It has not seemed to affect performance.  And only the 5 has some physical damage.\nBuyer: okay. shall we make it for $60. I will adjust my budget somehow..\nSeller: No.  I can't go that low.  \nBuyer: how much can you come down from $95?\nSeller: I cannot and will not go lower than 85\nBuyer: Let it be for both of us to down & up. Finalize for $65.\nSeller: I won't go lower than 85.  Sorry\nBuyer: Last deal for $70, because I like these iphones very much.\nSeller: 70 will not work for me\nBuyer: Okay. Then I'll have to quit and look for some other phones.\nSeller: I understand.  I am willing to  go half way between with you.  But, seriously, that is all I can do.  What if we split the difference and go 77 for both phones.  \n"

It runs like new pretty much.\nBuyer: Still with 157k miles I would only be able to pay 5000 is that agreeable?\nSeller: I can come down on the price a little bit but these are mostly highway miles so it's not as bad as you might think. How about 7500\nBuyer: That is still a little pricey for me i would be able to come today with 6090 in cash if you would agree to that?\nSeller: 7000 cash and its a deal\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"
