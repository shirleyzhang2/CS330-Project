Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non-soda drinker. I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me. It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'??? I would've hoped all the mixed fruit juices would've been enough... \n Summary: Not Up to Par Taste-wise",

I still prefer Donut Shop as a light everyday go to coffee choice, but wanted to try a box of Green Mountain BB.  Probably won't purchase again.  No one in the house has stopped me and said, \"thats a great cup of coffee\".  It's just plain and blah.  I'll probably struggle to finish the box honestly. \n Summary: not great",
