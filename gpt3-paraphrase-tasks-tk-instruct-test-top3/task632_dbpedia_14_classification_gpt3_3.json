        "In this task, you're given a text. You must determine if the text is generally about a person. Your answer must be \"Yes\" or \"No\". \"Yes\" means that the text is about a person. \"No\" means that the text is not about a person. Pay attention that for your answer to be \"Yes\", the passage should be generally about a person. Mentions of people in the text don't necessarily mean the text is about a person."
