Not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.",

            "input": "During my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant. How so you might ask? Well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they weren't even at the desk when I checked in. Also, When I ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. Finally, The bill was charging me for stuff I didn't want or ask for. But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. I give it a half a star.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "There are negative words in the review like 'unpleasant', 'terrible', 'bad' and the writer also gives half a star. therefore it is a negative review."

            "input": "My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer. And by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "There are negative words like 'terrible', 'defective', 'inconvenience and discomfort', 'dirty' which are bad for hotel room reviews."

The coincierge was very friendly when we need. The room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive. The internet access (WiFi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price, huge rooms, close to attractions at Loop, close to metro station. Cons: Expensive breakfast, Internet access charged. Tip: When leaving the building, always use the Michigan Av exit. Its a great view.",

The Staff was so nice and very helpfull. Donald, at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance, and on a Holiday weekend too. They were great seats and a reasonable price. He worked very hard for us to see that show. They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration. This will be my first pick when I return in the spring.",

Rooms were only serviceable, and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website. The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient. The 'fitness centre' was tiny and poor. We would not come here again.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "This is a negative review because the writer mentions in the first line that it was not worth it and there are some negative words like 'rude', 'contemptuous' and 'inconvenient'. Hence this is a negative review."

Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (FCCLA) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. The noise at night from every direction. The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic. With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another, absolutely ridiculous. The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo. During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasn't anything they could do. ...read more\n",

It is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more \"botique\" . The carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! The bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. We told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. The elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. I did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. What a disappointment :(\n",

We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened. We asked for and recieved a room on a non-smoking floor. They did not bring up the key, we had to go down to the lobby to get it. Breakfast could have had some healthy choices, the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh. Bananas not ripe. Room only had ONE wash cloth, had to call down for more. Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room. Not for turndown service , not for the morning clean -up. Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign. They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would. We finally told them not to come because of the time. We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner. Never greeted by anyone as we came and went. I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham. The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed there.I will NEVER stay at this hotel again, Not worth 300.00 a night\n",
