        "You will be given a sentence, and you must classify it as either acceptable or not. A sentence is acceptable if it is grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker, and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence is acceptable, output \"acceptable\". Otherwise, output \"unacceptable\"."
