The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once. As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant. \n Summary: Unusual flavor......",

We all remarked how delicious and tasty it made our tea.  We've been using it ever since. A little goes a long way and I use it anytime I would ordinarily use a sweetener.  Since the artificial sweeteners are so unsafe and unhealthy and I have a sweet tooth, I felt this was a safe alternative. Not only is it safer, but there's no aftertaste and doesn't raise your blood sugar level. This particular stevia has absolutely no bitter taste to it. I've tried others before and since and there's no comparison. \n Summary: The Best Stevia",
