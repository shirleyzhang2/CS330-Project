I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

Also most of the interior has been corrected\nBuyer: Would you be willing to accept $14260?\nSeller: That is a little too steep of a drop this was initially my grandfathers project but he unfortunately passed on.

We are about a 45 minute drive but if you can get it to me for 125 ill cut your grass when i pick it up\nSeller: I'm in a condo, it's already taken care of but nice of you to offer.  You're killing me!!  The lowest I can go is $150\nBuyer: I might be able to do 150 but i will have to ask my new boss to loan me the money :/ it would be great if you could help me out and I will pay it forward in the future to a stranger :)\nSeller: You know what, I really appreciate what you're saying but this is a great bike and I'm already losing by selling it for $150.  I have to get $150.  Stop breaking my heart!!\nBuyer: Ahh make me one more compromise, i know im the worst. i can scrounge an extra 15 up, how about 140?\nSeller: ok you drive a hard bargain.  please remember to pay it forward.  $140 - sold to the whinney person over there!  lol\nBuyer: You are the best :) Thank you this is super helpful for me, see you soon!\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"
