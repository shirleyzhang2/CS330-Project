Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",
            "output": "Good review",

            "input": "My son received this book as a gift. I was extremely disappointed. It is an old book, and the print quality and size are unreadable. At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

            "input": "This is a terrific product. It does exactly as advertised and it was much less expensive here than at the store. Easy to attach & adjust both cameras from one DVR. We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Just another short story. I would have liked more substance from this book. But, again, what happened was okay. Not very long. I wasn't thrilled. This author can certainly improve on her craft. And when it comes down to it, she needs to.",

            "input": "I am a fan of the series for years. This is another weak entry in that long line of movies with little to no story line. As usual, Johnny Depp was excellent as ever, but the poor story, bad script, even worse acting, made every scene boring. If this wasn't on my video shelf, it would be out from under me!! My advice: Don't waste your money unless you are dying for an addiction and need something, anything. Otherwise, check online or wait for it at Blockbuster.",
