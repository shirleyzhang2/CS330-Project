It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale.",
