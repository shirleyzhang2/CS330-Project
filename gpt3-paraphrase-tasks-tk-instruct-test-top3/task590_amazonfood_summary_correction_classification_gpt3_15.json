I am usually not a big candy eater, but I have to say that I was really impressed.  The Werther's Chewy Caramels were so richly flavored and chewy that I couldn't stop at just one (I usually stop at one for most other candies).  They have a great buttery flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  I like the fact that they have some great ingredients, like cream and butter, but I had to deduct one star for the fact that there are artificial flavors in them (I am an avid label reader and try to stay away from any artificial ingredients).  As far as the taste goes, my kids and my husband were constantly in the pantry looking to grab another candy, so I can confidently say these were a huge hit in our family.  It was also a great incentive for the kids to eat their vegetables at dinner- they certainly cleaned their plate to have a couple of caramels for dessert.  If you are having a party, these would be great set out in a candy dish.  There will be none left by the end! \n Summary: Mmmmmmm....Sooo good!!!",
