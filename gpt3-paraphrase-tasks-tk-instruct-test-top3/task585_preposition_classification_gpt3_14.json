    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you're given an input that contains two words. Your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition you choose should explicitly convey the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", a possible preposition would be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
