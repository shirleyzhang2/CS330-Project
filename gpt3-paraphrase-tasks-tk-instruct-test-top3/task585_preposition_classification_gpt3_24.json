    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you will receive two words. Your task is to predict the preposition that connects these two words. The preposition you predict should explicitly convey the meaning of both words. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", a possible preposition would be \"of\", as in \"king of fort\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
