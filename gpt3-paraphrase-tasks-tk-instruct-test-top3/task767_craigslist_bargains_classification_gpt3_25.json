I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

I would be willing to trade you that plus $5000 cash.  This way you get a great running truck that can handle the mountains and some cash in your pocket.  Deal?\nSeller: It sounds good but what's the condition of the suv?\nBuyer: The SUV is in great condition.  I had new tires put on last winter.  I have a Carfax report so you can see that it hasn't had accidents.  The main reason I want to get rid of it is because I want better gas mileage with a car rather than an SUV.  So do we have a deal for $5000?\nSeller: Make it 5900 + the suv and we've got a deal.\nBuyer: Deal!  Thanks!\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"

Can you tell me what you mean by \"it has a rough character?\"\nSeller: It just means that it is handmade and so that light still shines through the joints. The table is in amazing condition and is a handmade piece.\nBuyer: It's a little small for what you're asking and there's no warranty on it, would you be willing to take $270 for the table?  \nSeller: The price is firm, I have a little wiggle room, but I couldn't go that low. It is well priced for being a handmade piece.\nBuyer: Well I understand that, but I'm comparing it to several others that I'm considering and it's significantly more expensive.  How about if I come pick it up, would you let it go for $350?\nSeller: You picking it up is necessary and I would split the difference with you at $400.\nBuyer: Hmm that's just really out of my budget, what if it breaks within the first week?  I feel very uncomfortable about no warranty with this table.  \nSeller: If you pay $400 and pick it up today I will give it a 6 month warranty.\nBuyer: Okay, will you put that in writing when I pick it up?\nSeller: Sure!\nSeller: \nBuyer: Okay!  I'm on my way!\nBuyer: \n"

How about 7,500?\nSeller: The value of the car is worth 12,000 and im selling only for 10,900\nBuyer: With a clean title maybe, but can't go that high for a salvage title even if running well. I can go as high as 8,500. Final offer\nSeller: How about 10,000 and i will fix the dent for you \nBuyer: If you fix the dent, we can do 9,500. Sound good?\nSeller: Ok that will work\nBuyer: Great\nBuyer: \nSeller: \n"
