The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on.",

These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.  I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese \"treats\"",

However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best.",
