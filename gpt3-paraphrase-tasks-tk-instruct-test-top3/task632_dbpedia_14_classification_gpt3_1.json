        "In this task, you're given a text which is the body of the document. Your task is to determine whether the text is about a person. If the text is about a person, indicate your answer as \"Yes\". If the text is not about a person, indicate your answer as \"No\". Pay attention that for your answer to be \"Yes\", the passage should be generally about a person. Mentions of people in the text don't necessarily mean the text is about a person."
