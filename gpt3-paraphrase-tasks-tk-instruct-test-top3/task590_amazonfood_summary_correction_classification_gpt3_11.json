Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.  Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care. \n Summary: Don't waste your money",

            "input": "Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT.......DO NOT......DO NOT purchase Uncle Ray's 16 oz Wavy potato chips  OCTOBER 03, 2012  Bought Uncle Ray's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor.  The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n Summary: PLEASE!!!!!Don't waste your money",
