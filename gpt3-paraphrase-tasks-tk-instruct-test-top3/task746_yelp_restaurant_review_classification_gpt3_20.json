            "input": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6:30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur\u00e9e and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",
            "output": "positive",
            "explanation": "Although the reviewer cites a few concerns, the overall tone of the review aligns more towards towards the positive side. Some of the key terms like 'revitalization','all lovely', 'luckily there was nothing to worry about', 'very good', etc. suggests that the reviewer was satisfied with the restaurant"

            "input": "I've stayed at many Marriott and Renaissance Marriott's and this was a huge disappointment! The front desk and atrium is nice..there is a starbucks on site which is nice.The rooms are run down and old.  There is a flat screen but that is to be expected of a Renaissance.We got this hotel via Priceline at a rate of $75\\/night...good deal for the price but this is not a true Renaissance.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The review strongly expresses the dissatifaction along with some pros about the restaurant. The negatives outweighs the positives which is quite evident from the fact that despite all the positives, the reviewer calls this restaurant a huge disappointment"

I'm a fan now, too.Evan and Cody showed up right on time for my move this past weekend. They were friendly and energetic, working quickly but carefully to get all my things moved out of the old place and into the new one in less than 2.5 hours.",
            "output": "positive",

There are so many better places in davis square where they are glad you are visiting their business. Sad that the burren is now the worst place in davis.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The person believes that the place is no longer the cool place it once was and also adds to it by calling this place the worst. Hence, it's negative."

            "input": "This store is pretty good. Not as great as Walmart (or my preferred, Milford Target), but closer and in a easier area to get to.  The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the staff are friendly (most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general (they pricematch too!). Christian, Debbie, Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd \\/ Route 30. 4 stars.",
            "output": "negative",
            "explanation": "The reviewer feels that the store may not be in the same standards as Walmart or Milford Target but is still happy with the cleanliness, self checkout and customer assistance. So the label is positive and not negative"

            "explanation": "Although, the customer is not a fan of the restaurant's super loud nature, they love the food and the services offered at this restaurant. But this is labeled as negative, which isn't right."

            "input": "Mediocre coffee at best. Never coming here again. I ordered a coffee and it came hot instead of iced and I politely asked if I can have it iced. The rude  barista tells me that it costs $5 and he won't make it again... Yes I know it costs $5 because I already paid for it asshole! Then he paid a big deal when I asked him to give me a cup with ice after he refuses to make me another drink. Such a simple request in my part didn't deserve such attitude. Please learn about good customer service especially when one is paying so much for a watered down drink at best. I will rather go to any Starbucks in the area ( there are two) than ever go to this place again as there is friendly staff and cheaper drink options.",

It was so loud from the children in the waiting area,  the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level, the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium, and other waitstaff conversation  (including a high five session). We could not hear or have our own conversation. The food. Well it is what it is, whoch is why I don't regularly go to the OG and don't expect too much, they didn't improve on my opinion. We ordered two never ending bowl, one with chicken (highly over priced at $4). Had two refills.  On all dishes there was very little sauce.  The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and 5 small mushroom pieces (nothing like the advertisements). On the second refill with chicken, the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate, one with red sauce, removed and placed (red sauce and all) on to the bowl with white sauce.",

I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business, but this place came pretty close. I came in a few times, and each time, the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a **** that I was in his shop. On top of that, he didnt have some items that any shop should have (irrelevant now, but had no 26' rim strip and had just 2 motley saddles). Ive worked in a shop before, and customers are the lifeblood of the shop - bummer this guy didnt realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under.",
