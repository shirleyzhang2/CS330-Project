        "In this task, you will be given a text and a title. The title will be present in the text, and it will refer to the entity that is mentioned in the text. The title might have some text in parentheses, for example: \"HMS Mallow (K81)\", or be slightly different from what is present in the text. If they still refer to the same entity, then it is a correct title. Indicate your answer as \"Yes\" if the title is correct, otherwise indicate your answer as \"No\"."
