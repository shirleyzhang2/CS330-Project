    "Definition": [
        "In this task you will read an exchange between two senders, and you will need to determine whether the first sender is a 'Bot' or a 'Human'. You can assume that there are only a maximum of two senders per conversation, and that there are no conversations where both senders are bots or both senders are humans. Knowing this, you only need to classify the first sender as 'Human' or 'Bot'; you do not need to write anything about the second sender. Typically, bots will have a more disjointed manner of speaking, and will make statements that don't relate to each other, don't make coherent sense, or otherwise appear unnatural. Humans will make statements in a more or less coherent and logical way, potentially including asking the bot why the bot is not making sense or contradicting itself."

            "input": "SENDER A: I love iphone! i just bought new iphone!\nSENDER B: Thats good for you, i'm not very into new tech\nSENDER A: I am a college student and i am a college student\nSENDER B: I am go to gym and live on donations\nSENDER A: I am a vegan and i am in the midwest\nSENDER B: So vegan... i have dogs maybe i should told then that they may eat cheap salads insted of meat\nSENDER A: I would not mind having them in the office that would be hard for me\nSENDER B: Dogs or vegan in office?\nSENDER A: I am a vegetarian so i am vegan\nSENDER B: Strange answer\nSENDER A: I guess i just do not know what to ps4 experience with.\n",
            "output": "Bot",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification, because SENDER A is indeed a bot. You can tell SENDER A is a bot because they make statements that don't have anything to do with what SENDER B is asking. SENDER A also repeats itself awkwardly in the same sentence ('I am a college student and i am a college student'), which humans don't usually do. Additionally, you can tell SENDER A is the bot in this conversation because since there are two senders, one must be a bot and one must be a human, and SENDER B clearly sounds more like the human since their sentences are coherent and they are trying to carry a logical conversation. Finally, after SENDER A sends an incoherent answer, SENDER B correctly points out SENDER A's awkwardness by saying 'Strange answer', which can reliably indicate SENDER B is the human, and SENDER A is the bot."

            "output": "Human",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification. SENDER A is indeed a human, and you can tell by the logical way they try to hold a conversation. When SENDER B brings up the gym, SENDER A tries to find out if SENDER B is a sportsman. SENDER B changes the subject to how they both like and dislike fish; this is a two-fold indication that SENDER B is the bot because of the unrelated/unprompted nature of the response, and the contradictory nature of it. The rest of the conversation further cements that SENDER B is incoherent and thus probably the bot, so SENDER A is the human."

            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because SENDER A is actually a human. While SENDER B starts out holding the conversation fairly well while asking about colors, you should be able to tell SENDER A is the human by the time SENDER B's speech becomes disjointed and they contradict themselves about working at a 'local shelter' as well as a 'grocery store'. SENDER A correctly points out the contradiction, indicating they are the likely human. Finally, SENDER B repeatedly sends non-sequiturs, such as the closing 'I will have to go to the hospital'."
