Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

It shows a generic cartridge, so I can not judge what this one is, and how good it is. This review has no influence on whether someone will purchase it, but rather why they are showing the photo as shown. The cartridge seems to work, except for two things:1. Not all 3 colors worked. There were only 2 left in each color cartridge.2. Only black printed clearly.",

            "input": "I had high hopes for this DVD and bought it after reading all of the good reviews. To my surprise, what arrived was actually quite boring. When the students sang these songs in concert - they were fantastic. After watching the performances on the DVD, you would think that the performers lacked chemistry or just weren't able to sing live. In a lot of cases (especially one song ) - there seemed no life left in their efforts. As far as singing skills go... yeah. Maybe it's me.",

There are some helpful parts of the book, but all in all, it was garbage! Do NOT recommend! I wish people would quit writing negative reviews for books that actually can help people, like this one can. But hey, at least I'll get more money from amazon.",
