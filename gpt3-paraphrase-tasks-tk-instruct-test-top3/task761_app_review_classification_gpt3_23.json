When I connect my BT headset  I have it set to read important notifications - add that to Google Now's                 ability to create texts  reminders and calendar events  and my $20 headset has all the functionality of a smartwatch.

The problem is that it is common for a device to be discharging when connected to a low power adapter (or cheap cable) because the device is using more current than is being provided. Under those conditions CurrentWidget reports a charging current when it is in fact a discharging current. So far the only app I've found that gets it right is GSAM. Unfortunately  the GSAM widget updates very slowly.",
