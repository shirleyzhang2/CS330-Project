        "Read the given query and classify it as a 'Good' or 'Bad' query depending on how well the query is formed. A 'Bad' query is one that is not well formed, while a 'Good' query is one that is well formed. A query may be wrong based on common sense or general facts, but if it is well formed, you should answer with Good."
