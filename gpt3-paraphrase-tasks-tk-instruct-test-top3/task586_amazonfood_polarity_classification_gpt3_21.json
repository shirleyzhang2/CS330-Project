I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon.",

            "input": "I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.  After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.  As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.  The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.  You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html",

I researched this company and they have been in business since 1898. This is the only preanut butter I really like. It is made with peanuts with no sugar and chemicals added to make it taste better.  It doesn't need to add anything,  Great product and seller was prompt and shipping was reasonable.",
