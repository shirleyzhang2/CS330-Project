    "Definition": [
        "The task is to classify a text passage as 'accepted' or 'rejected', based on a dialogue between a seller and buyer about the sale of an item. 'Accepted' means that, by the end of the conversation, the buyer seems likely to buy the item from the seller. This is indicated when the buyer and seller agree upon a common price or when a deal is made between them. 'Rejected' means that the buyer did not seem interested in buying the item from the seller at the end of the conversation. This happens when the buyer and seller do not agree on the price or other aspects of the item being sold by the seller."

Would you accept 100 for the board?\nSeller: No, that offer is too low. The board is pretty much brand new as it's been ridden only 4 or 5 times.  The bone bearings are brand new.\nBuyer: If I picked it up at your location would you accpet 120?\nSeller: Make it 150 and we got a deal. \nBuyer: I could do 145, if you can gurantee the painting on the front of the board is not scratched up. \nSeller: Deal\nBuyer: Great!",
            "output": "accepted",

How much for it?\nSeller: I am asking $26800. \nBuyer: How many miles on it?\nSeller: Only 16,473.\nBuyer: Has it had any major repairs?\nSeller: No, it has been accident free and in great condition.\nBuyer: Why are you selling it?\nSeller: starting to expand our family, time for an suv and baby seat.\nBuyer: I can give you 17000. That will buy a lot of diapers.\nSeller: I need the SUV. That is just way too low for me. Sorry you need to come way up.\nBuyer: I can do 20,000 if you throw in a 3 year warranty to cover any repairs that might naturally arise\nSeller: There is a warranty in place, so that is not a problem. But I need a minimum of 25000\nBuyer: How long is the warranty?\nSeller: Ten more years.\nBuyer: 22500 and you got a deal\nSeller: nO SORRY i am firm on the 25,000 being my lowest offer.\nBuyer: Can't do it.",
            "output": "rejected",
            "explanation": "The answer 'rejected' is correct because at the end of the conversation the buyer and seller do not agree to a common price. Since the buyer was asking for a price of 22500 and the seller was not accepting offers below 25000, the buyer did not decide to buy the item from the seller."

It looks nice I can't tell sorry.\nBuyer: will you do 500 ? i need to buy new beds and furtinure\nSeller: I can't do half. I am sorry. It has a garage and a fenced in yard if you have kids.\nBuyer: i can do 600 if you waive the deposit\nSeller: Honestly I think the lowest I can do is $800 with the deposit. I am sorry. That is what they go for in this neighborhood. \nBuyer: ok i can do 750 lowest and fits my bussdet\nSeller: Ok I think we can make a deal.\nBuyer: deal\n",

That is $1000 less then asking price.\nBuyer: My final offer would be 1850.00\nSeller: I really don't think I could go that low.\nBuyer: What is your bottom line?\nSeller: For a 4 Bedroom, 2 1/2 bath with a 2 car garage in California. it has a tennis court a children play structure.I think the best I could is $2000.\nBuyer: I don't see anything in the listing about a tennis court or a child's play structure. I am not willing to go over $1850 and will assume all maintenance issues with this rental.\nSeller: You can't make another offer anyway. I can't erase your original offer. I am going to have to reject.\nBuyer: ok\n",
            "output": "yes",
            "explanation": "This answer 'yes' is incorrect here because it is not among the only two options 'accepted' or 'rejected' from which the answer is to be chosen. The correct answer is 'rejected' because the buyer and the seller are not able to agree upon the same price as seen in the conversation where the buyer is offering 1850 but the seller will not sell for under 2000 and so the seller rejects the buyer's offer. This indicates that the buyer does not end up buying the item from the seller."

Has it been in any accidents?\nSeller: No, it has not.\nBuyer: Are there any problems with the car that you know of?\nSeller: No it has been very well cared for and all maintenance has been done regularly.\nBuyer: I hate to sound nit picky, but did your parents smoke in the car or have pets in the car?\nSeller: I totally understand, no smoking and no pets.\nBuyer: Cool. I would love to purchase the car from you, but $4900 is a little much for me. I really only have $3400 to spend. Are you willing to come down on the price?\nSeller: I understand your situation but unfortunately I can only come down to $4500.\nBuyer: Oh no! I would be able to do maybe $3800, but that't my limit, I'm afraid. I can come pick it up wherever! I'll even bring you some cupcakes!\\\nSeller: I'm sorry but of the great condition the car is in my absolute lowest is $4300.\nBuyer: Damn. If you change your mind, let me know!\nBuyer: \n"

Is it new?\nSeller: no, however, its certified pre-owned. only reason i'm parting with it is because i'm moving. otherwise I would keep it.\nBuyer: That sounds great, but I'll pay it off right away! I'll give you 18,000.\nSeller: thats a little lower than i can part with it for. I was thinking more like 20,000. it has a nice interior and sound system, rear camera, and very low mileage\nBuyer: Thats great, but it has 53,000 miles. How about 18500?\nSeller: for a 4 year old car, that is extremely low mileage. if you come and pick this car up, i'll let you have it for 19800. that's $1000 off of the asking price. that is my final offer.\nBuyer: If I come and pick it up, how about 1900.

Would you like me to schedule an appointment for you.\nBuyer: No, thank you. I am trying to make a move on a property today. This is one of several I am considering. This unit is in the less savory area of town so it seems a little pricey. Could you reduce the payment to $1700?\nSeller: Well I did consider that when I listed the property.  Some of the features are stainless steel appliances including a washer and dryer.  If you can get to $1750 I think we can make a deal.\nBuyer: I do love stainless steel!
