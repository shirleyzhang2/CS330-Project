    "Definition": [
        "Classify the given story as 'imagined', 'recalled', or 'retold'. 'Imagined' means the person who wrote the story is making it up, pretending they experienced it. 'Recalled' means the person who wrote the story really experienced it and is recalling it from memory. 'Retold' means it is a real memory like the 'recalled' stories, but written down much later after previously writing a 'recalled' story about the same events. So, 'recalled' stories and 'retold' stories will be fairly similar, in that they both were real experiences for the writer. 'Imagined' stories have a more linear flow and contain more commonsense knowledge, whereas 'recalled' stories are less connected and contain more specific concrete events. Additionally, higher levels of self reference are found in 'imagined' stories. Between 'recalled' and 'retold' stories, 'retold' stories flow significantly more linearly than 'recalled' stories, and 'retold' stories are significantly higher in scores for cognitive processes and positive tone."

            "input": "Concerts are my most favorite thing, and my boyfriend knew it. That's why, for our anniversary, he got me tickets to see my favorite artist. Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because it really was an imagined story. The attributes that should tip you off are that the story is light on concrete events (they describe things in broad terms such as going to a restaurant and being at the stadium, but nothing specific about who was exactly where and anything specifically notable someone said or did) and heavy on references to the writer themselves and their internal feelings (they frequently repeat how much they loved it, how romantic they felt, how they cherished the night, etc). It's also very linear and structured, pointing to this being an imagined story. Additionally, the events and feelings described seem a little romanticized or idealized beyond what is usually a realistic circumstance."

            "input": "Five months ago, my niece and nephew were born. They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt. It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins! When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them. I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted. They wanted to spend time alone as a new family. I will never forget holding the babies for the first time. My niece especially was tiny. They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds. My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger. We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins. They were both so perfect and tiny. I was like holding tiny dolls. I will never forget that day. I love them more than I ever expected I would.",
            "output": "recalled",
            "explanation": "This is a good example of correct classification because the story actually was recalled by someone who experienced this. There are specific concrete details about the twins size and the new mother's feelings that point to this being a real recalled event rather than an imagined fabrication. Notably, it is understandable that an emotional event such as a birth elicits strong recollection of the writer's own emotions. These recalled emotions, however, seem more believable and less idealized than emotions in imagined stories."

            "input": "Me and my girlfriend had gone to the Los Angeles Zoo. I can't exactly remember the day but I believe it was either April or May or maybe June. It was a hot day that day and it was spur of the moment trip. I honestly wasn't particularly excited to go but my girlfriend had been bugging me for months to go to the zoo so I finally said let's go. We got there around 10 or 11 in the morning and it was already around 90 degrees. When we walked in there was the insect/reptile section of the zoo so we saw many exotic looking spiders, snakes, scorpions etc. I liked it but my girlfriend didn't like insects. Then we walked in the African animals section. We saw elephants mostly and we could hear monkeys and apes in the distance somewhere. So we keep walking and eventually we find the apes. We saw gorillas hanging out in the shade and in a different section we saw other chimps and monkeys. We walked past that and we saw giraffes. Watching the giraffes was a cool site because they got really close to us. Like one of them was looking at me and came in my direction and I thought it would actually do something to me. Then after we saw the lions and they were mostly hanging out in the shade to stay out of the heat. We continued to walk around and we saw a section with Australian animals. So we managed to see koalas in the tress and tasmanian devils. I think we also saw kangaroos but I can't remember. We spent a lot of time at the zoo maybe around 5-6 hours. I think we left and we got back home around 4 or 5 pm.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is a good example because the story really is a retold one; the writer had previously written a recalled account of the same events. However, you can tell that, while there are plenty of concrete details (pointing to it being a real story, instead of an imagined one), the writer has forgotten some basic things such as the month it took place. For this reason, you should be suspecting some sufficient amount of time has passed, such that the memory is no longer fresh. This is characteristic of retold stories."

            "input": "I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",
            "output": "retold",
            "explanation": "This is an example of incorrect classification because the story is actually imagined. You can tell it is likely imagined based on the highly structured linear sequence of events. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories have more semantically disconnected adjacent sentences. This story is also rife with common-sense knowledge like the stereotypical fear of gangs by a tourist in a bad part of a foreign country. Imagined stories make more use of such common-sense knowledge, moreso than specific, unique concrete events."

            "input": "This event occurred over 3 months ago. I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more. Because one day, she will not be there. After the compelling conversation, we then proceeded to plan a mother/daughter day. We planned to eat tacos that weekend and watch a movie together, which we did. It was honestly of the best weekends ever. Very moving moment for me.",
            "output": "imagined",
            "explanation": "This is an example of misclassification because the story is actually recalled. You can tell it is recalled by the specific, unique details in the account. As per the definition, recalled/retold stories 'rely more on autobiographical events based on episodic memory', of which this story has many (the details about the mom not being able to swim, the fridge and the hallway, the plan to eat tacos, etc) and which are not necessarily thematically connected in any common-sense way."

The party started out with her doing a dance. Then we went outside to eat some pizza and play. After the pizza, she wanted to play with some barbies. I decided to play with her so we went upstairs to her room to get the barbies. It took us a few minutes to decided how many to get. Her little brother also joined us. All together we probably had eight or nine barbies and a large bus for the barbies. Unfortunately, by the time we had retrieved all the barbies it was time for cake and for a six year old, cake trumps. We sang her happy birthday and lit the cake. Then she proceeded to try and blow out the candles for the next three to four minutes to no avail. It turns out her parent's had put trick candles on the cake and we all had a good laugh about it. After the cake we put some music on and danced a bit more. Finally everybody started to say their goodbyes and we all left the birthday with a few new toys and a belly full of cake.",

One day, I noticed that they had open submissions for poets. It was mentioned that only a select few entries would be chosen for the next publication. Very close to my birthday, I found out I was chosen! What's more is that this was the first time that I had ever submitted any of my work for review. I couldn't believe that I was chosen for publishing without any previous portfolio. I was one of thirty, out of hundreds of submissions. It was amazing enough that they thought my work was worthy, but I later found out that all my friends did, as well! In the form of a surprise tea party, my friends decided to gather and congratulate me for my first published work. I couldn't believe it! They rented a beachhouse, and decorated it all pink. Pink is my favorite color of course! They had also purchased all sorts of teas and baked goods. The party was perfect. I felt so accomplished. Most importantly, I felt so loved.",

At that time, we had chatted for a while and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out and ultimately we took a month or so break from communication again. It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family -- the travel route of which would take my by the town where she lived while going to school -- that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more? When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spend walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer. At the end of the day, we went to her place -- both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then we've been seeing each other almost every week. I think back to that day a lot as the start of something wonderful.",
