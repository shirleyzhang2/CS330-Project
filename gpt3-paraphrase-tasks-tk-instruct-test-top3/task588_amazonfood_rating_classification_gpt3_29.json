Internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable. No more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the \"big city\". I am on a first name basis with the UPS and FedEx drivers. USPS shipments are hit and miss, if they fit in the mailbox, great, if not, then it's saddle up and head to town. Pico Pica is our favorite product, it is so good!  Love it!",
