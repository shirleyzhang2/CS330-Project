        "Given a sentence, classify whether the sentence is acceptable or not by the standards given. A sentence is acceptable if it is grammatically correct, has a naturalistic text, is written by a native speaker and minimizes superfluous content. If the sentence meets these requirements, then write \"acceptable\". Otherwise, write \"unacceptable\"."
