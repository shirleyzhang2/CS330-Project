            "input": "Packaging on these leaves something to be desired - last shipment I received had 2 out of 3 boxes with the corners crushed and when I opened the first one and removed the bag, there were a lot of broken biscotti.  I expect it will be the same for the other box that was damaged.  Given that these are fairly fragile, they should be given better protection from being crushed by the shippers.  The biscotti themselves are tasty, if a bit small.  I wish they were full-sized, 3 or 4 inches long instead of an inch and a half.  But as I live in a rural area where people think \"biscotti\" is a kind of biscuit, these are a good second choice.",

The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks.",
