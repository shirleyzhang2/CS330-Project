I will have to keep looking for now.\nSeller: good luck",

I have barely taken it out of the box. \nBuyer: How much can you give it for?\nSeller: The price is $55\nBuyer: Yeah but its too much for me\nSeller: I understand that would normally be a lot for a used DVD player but this item has only been used for one week.  \nBuyer: Yeah, but there are a lot of different options in the market. I am a student and can only afford what my budget allows me to do so. I can pay $41. Will you accept it?\nSeller: I understand a student's budget, as I have no to long ago graduated myself. I just am already letting it go real cheap. I paid $130 for the product. The only reason I am parting with it is that It only streams the big streaming channels like Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and Youtube and I bought a DVD player/Android Box combo that will allow me to stream those plus add my own channels. I can't possibly sell it for $41. \nBuyer: Okay I can only afford $48 that's the last I can pay\nSeller: Make it $50 and we have a deal. I know it is a stretch to your budget but trust me with everything this player does, you will save more than $2 on entertainment",

However, I have a few questions.\nSeller: Sure, go ahead.\nBuyer: Has it been in any major accidents?\nSeller: No, I`ve kept it in very good condition.\nBuyer: All of the electronics are in working order, correct?\nSeller: Yes, everything has been checked out recently.\nBuyer: Great! Would you take $10,000? 120k miles is kinda a lot.\nSeller: I`m open to negotiate but 10k is a bit low. We could meet in the middle and say 13 000? I`ll include the extra speakers I recently purchased.\nBuyer: 13,000 is fair, however I can only afford paying 12,500\nSeller: Alright, I think that`s reasonable. We can agree on 12,500 then.\nBuyer: Great!",

The issue here - is that we do not exactly cover the s8 for this price as you see in the ad. However it is at your own risk, as new model phones are still a bit on the frontier \nBuyer: How do you bypass esn/imei blacklisting? Do you drop in a new stolen chip or do you use a tunneling electron microscope to physically burnin\nSeller: I can not specifically tell you our methods, as it is the only reason we are in business, If you would like to go elsewhere please feel no pressure. However if you would like to precede please do let me know, we can continue for 65 dollars, plus tax\nBuyer: The best I can do is $45.\nSeller: Okay, however can I net 30 you the cost of supplies ?\nBuyer: Okay, I'll accept your offer.\nSeller: before you accept this please understand the cost of supplies is 11 dollars\nBuyer: Okay, sounds good.\nSeller: Deal - 56 dollars is the final deal\nSeller: \nBuyer: \n"
