        "In this task, you're given a text which is the body of a document and a title which is the title of the document. The title might have some text in parentheses, for example: \"HMS Mallow (K81)\", or be slightly different from what is present in the text. If they still refer to the same entity, then it is a correct title. Indicate your answer as \"Yes\" if the title is correct, otherwise indicate your answer as \"No\"."
