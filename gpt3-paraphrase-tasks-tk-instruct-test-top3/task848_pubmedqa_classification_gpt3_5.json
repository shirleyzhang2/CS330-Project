Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

            "input": "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

Using HumanMethylation450 arrays, we examined candidate gene-associated CpGs in cord blood from newborns with low (<15th centile), medium (40-60th centile) and high (>85th centile) BWC (n = 12). Candidates were examined in an investigation cohort (n = 110) using pyrosequencing and genotyping for putative methylation-associated polymorphisms performed using standard PCR. Array analysis identified 314 candidate genes associated with BWC extremes, four of which showed \u2265 4 BWC-linked CpGs. Of these, PM20D1 and MI886 suggested genetically determined methylation levels. However, methylation at three CpGs in FGFR2 remained significantly associated with high BWC (p = 0.004-0.027).",

            "input": "Tumor microenvironment immunity is associated with breast cancer outcome. A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

In unadjusted analysis, all comorbidities were diagnosed significantly more in HS compared with control including (in rank order of likelihood): smoking, arthropathies, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, psychiatric disorders, obesity, drug dependence, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, alcohol dependence, and lymphoma (all P < .01).",

We sought to determine the role of preoperative serum TF levels in predicting clinical outcome in patients with ovarian cancer.', 'TF expression was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in ovarian cell lines. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we assessed preoperative serum TF levels in 98 women with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma, 30 with low malignant potential (LMP) tumors, 16 with benign tumors, and a separate validation group of 39 women with adnexal masses. Clinical information was gathered from chart review.', 'TF was expressed in four of the five ovarian cancer cell lines, but absent in the nontransformed cells. Ovarian cancer patients had a median preoperative serum TF level of 85.2 pg/mL, which was significantly higher than in those with LMP tumors (12.8 pg/mL; P < .01) and benign adnexal disease (30.7 pg/mL; P < .01). TF >or= 190 pg/mL was significantly associated with decreased patient survival (P < .01). After adjusting for other clinical variables in a multivariate Cox regression model, TF >or= 190 pg/mL was an independent prognostic factor (P < .01). Analysis of serum TF levels from the validation set confirmed that high TF (>or=190 pg/mL) was associated with a 3.4-fold increase in risk of death from disease (P = .02) and shorter survival (P = .01).",

To assess stent strut distribution, the maximum interstrut angle was measured with a protractor centered on the stent, and the visible struts were counted and normalized for the number of stent cells. In SES restenosis patients, minimum lumen site was compared with image slices 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 mm proximal and distal to this site. The minimum lumen site had a smaller IVUS lumen area at follow-up (2.7+/-0.9 versus 6.2+/-1.9 mm2; P<0.01), larger maximum interstrut angle (135+/-39 degrees versus 72+/-23 degrees; P<0.01), larger IH area (3.4+/-1.5 versus 0.6+/-1.1 mm2; P<0.01) and thickness (0.7+/-0.3 versus 0.1+/-0.2 mm; P<0.01) at maximum interstrut angle, and fewer stent struts (4.9+/-1.0 versus 6.0+/-0.5; P<0.01) even when normalized for the number of stent cells (0.78+/-0.15 versus 0.97+/-0.07; P<0.01). Compared with nonrestenotic SES, the restenosis lesions also had a smaller minimal lumen area, larger IH area, thicker IH at maximum interstrut angle, fewer stent struts, and larger maximum interstrut angle. Multivariate analysis identified the number of visualized stent struts normalized for the number of stent cells and maximum interstrut angle as the only independent IVUS predictor of IH cross-sectional area (P<0.01 and P<0.01), minimum lumen area (P<0.01 and P<0.01), and IH thickness (P<0.01 and P<0.01).",
