Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

            "input": "My son received this book as a gift. I was extremely disappointed. It is an old book, and the print quality and size are unreadable. At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

            "input": "This is a terrific product. It does exactly as advertised and it was much less expensive here than at the store. Easy to attach & adjust both cameras from one DVR. We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

But they charge well just not long enough for my situation. Next time I will try one like Sony OEM. Not as expensive and work much better. Very disappointed as it is almost needed at this point where we live with out electricity. And there are no other batteries from Amazon or local stores but another vendor on Amazon.",

The \"gift\" is about like what you would get in one of those paper bags that they shove inside every Christmas present, but it didn't cost much! A total waste. It's cheaply made and looks it. It takes 2 AAA batteries each. Don't even bother.",

The side effects were horrible in about two weeks, until we came across our dog with some severe infections. Her eyes looked awful, she had massive sores all over and the little pounces that kept getting stuck in her throat just became too painful.",
