I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my \"chowhound\") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up.",

I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.  Side effects can include: *diarrhea *intestinal cramps or gripping pains *rash *severe weight loss  Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.  Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.  I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!",
