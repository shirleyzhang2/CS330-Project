I filled them with their usual training treats, and the dogs loved them...they played with them for about 30 minutes trying to get to the treats.  Then...the two dogs figured if they bit off the ball on the end of the rope, they could get the treats to fall out sooner.  Yup...within 30 minutes the plastic ropes were destroyed.  It could really be a danger to dogs if swallowed.  (This is why I watch the dogs when they get new toys...and thank goodness I did.)
