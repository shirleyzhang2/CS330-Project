Otherwise she carries them and hides them like bones, and, trust me, it's no fun to find to find a slobbery lamb/barley biscuit under your pillow when you go to bed! 2) What the heck is barley doing in a dog treat? It doesn't seem to me that dogs were designed to graze in barley fields, so why are we feeding them barley? 3) My dog seemed to really enjoy the flavor, so these at least have that going for them.",

You have to be careful with the microwaving part, but even when you are, it's hard to get consistent results. They also could be a little spicier for my taste.",
