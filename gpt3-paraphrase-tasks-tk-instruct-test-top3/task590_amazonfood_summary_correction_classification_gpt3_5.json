I was expecting something sweet or plain which I could throw on my morning oatmeal. However, they aren't a bad product, if you like salted and seasoned nuts.  I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking. \n Summary: Has a bitter taste.",

Amazon doesn't seem to think it's an issue since the seller can charge whatever they want for the item.
