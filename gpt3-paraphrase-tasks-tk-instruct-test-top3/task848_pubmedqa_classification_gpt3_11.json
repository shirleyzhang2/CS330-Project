Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

            "input": "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

The objectives of this study were to determine the role of miR-494 in GC malignancy and to identify its target genes.', 'Real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to quantify the expression level of miR-494 and c-myc in gastric cancer tissues. Bioinformatics was used to predict the downstream target genes of miR-494, which were confirmed by luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Cell functional analyses and a xenograft mouse model were used to evaluate the role of miR-494 in malignancy.', \"miR-494 was downregulated in human GC tissues and in GC cells and was negatively correlated with c-myc expression. High level of c-myc or low level of miR-494 correlated with poor prognosis. The miR-494-binding site in the c-myc 3' untranslated region was predicted using TargetScan and was confirmed by the luciferase assay. Additionally, c-myc and miR-494 were enriched in coimmunoprecipitates with tagged Argonaute2 proteins in cells overexpressing miR-494. Furthermore, a miR-494 mimic significantly downregulated endogenous c-myc expression, which may contribute to the delayed G1/S transition, decreased synthesis phase bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and impaired cell growth and colony formation; on the other hand, treatment with a miR-494 inhibitor displayed the opposite effects. Reduced tumor burden and decreased cell proliferation were observed following the delivery of miR-494 into xenograft mice.",

The half-life of infliximab is shorter in patients with ASUC than in patients with non-severe UC, so more frequent dosing might be required to produce a therapeutic effect.', 'We performed a retrospective analysis of 50 hospitalized patients who received infliximab for steroid-refractory ASUC at a single academic center from September 2005 through 2013. In 2011 an accelerated dosing strategy for infliximab was introduced; we compared outcomes of standard and accelerated dosing regimens. One group of patients (n\\xa0= 35) were placed on a standard dosing regimen for infliximab and then given the drug at 0, 2, and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter. A second group (n\\xa0= 15) were placed on an accelerated regimen and received 3 induction doses of infliximab within a median period of 24 days. Rates of colectomy were compared between the groups during induction and follow-up periods.', 'There were no differences between groups in median baseline levels of C-reactive protein, albumin, or hemoglobin. The rate of colectomy during induction therapy was significantly lower with the accelerated regimen (6.7%, 1 of 15) than with the standard regimen (40%, 14 of 35) (Fisher exact test, P\\xa0= .039). The standard regimen was associated with shorter time to colectomy (log-rank test, P\\xa0= .042). Among patients who completed induction therapy, subsequent need for colectomy was similar between the groups during the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with successful induction therapy were level of albumin (g/L) when the treatment began (P\\xa0= .003) and the accelerated dosing regimen (P\\xa0= .03).",
