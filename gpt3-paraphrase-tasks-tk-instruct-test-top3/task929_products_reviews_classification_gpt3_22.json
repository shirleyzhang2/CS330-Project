Other than that, its a simple design with nothing fancy. I love how cheap they were for 10 dollars... But overall nice design... No one can steal me earphones. lol thanks again amazon.",

            "input": "My son received this book as a gift. I was extremely disappointed. It is an old book, and the print quality and size are unreadable. At age 4, my 2 year old needs visual help to identify parts of his body at play. Maybe it would be OK for an older child with better sight. But don't waste your time or money. Go buy the new version called &#34;Brain Power--Make Sense Of Opposites&#34; instead.",

We are buying 4 more of these for our other cameras. It looks like security personnel will now start to see us more often because they know how easy it is. Only drawback I could possibly come up with is that it's so sturdy we wonder if it needs some sort of tether attached to it. But no - it doesn't.",

It has an extremely light blue hue and looks nothing like any normal light fixture. Not even close to as bright or crisp looking in person & obviously very CHEAP made. Just pay a little more for something better. You will be completely satisfied with this product.",

Most books on this subject include their daily way of life or how they live. However, while Mr. DeMoss does cover these topics, and that he clearly wants to make an impact with them, reading the book becomes more annoying as time passes because you keep thinking his comments are just not true. Also, the information seems incomplete.",

He must keep up his family and himself together until money can be obtained for the funeral. The author has an interesting way with words that I will most likely reread. It was also very sad at times, but showed how important it is when you love someone. Good job! And yes, I'd read another one if there were one.",
