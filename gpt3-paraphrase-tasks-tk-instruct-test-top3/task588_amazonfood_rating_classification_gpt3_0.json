I ordered 2 lbs of the honey and received brown sugar instead. When I tried to return it for the right product (the honey) I got absolutely NO RESPONSE. None. I sent countless emails, but nothing. It is a great product with a great taste, but the company is a little dodgy, so be careful.",

Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.  Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):  (1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)  (2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US  (3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)  (4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.  Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.",

This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.  While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive.",
