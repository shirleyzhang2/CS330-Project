    "Definition": [
        "In this task, you're given an input that contains two words. Your task is to predict the correct preposition that connects these two words. The preposition should explicitly convey both words' meaning. For example, if the two words are \"king\" and \"fort\", the correct preposition would be \"of\". Possible prepositions are: \"of\", \"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"from\", \"about\", and \"with\"."
