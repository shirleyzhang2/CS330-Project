That's because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.  You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.  I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice.",
