It also doesn't have a zip lock top and I thought it did like many of the other pouch foods and took this with us out to dinner. I ended up putting the leftovers in a plastic baggie. My baby also was not a fan of this at all and she is not a picky eater. Even my dogs turned their nose up at it and I thought it tasted pretty nasty.",
