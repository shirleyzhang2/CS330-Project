And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.",

For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!",
