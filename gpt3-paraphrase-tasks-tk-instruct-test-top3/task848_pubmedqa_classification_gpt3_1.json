Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 \u00b1 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).",

            "input": "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT), a liver enriched enzyme, is responsible for approximately one third of hepatic phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. 8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks. HV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

Candidates were examined in an investigation cohort (n = 110) using pyrosequencing and genotyping for putative methylation-associated polymorphisms performed using standard PCR. Array analysis identified 314 candidate genes associated with BWC extremes, four of which showed \u2265 4 BWC-linked CpGs.

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear. We analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival. We identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in post-chemotherapy residual tumor identified a profile (cluster Y), mainly characterized by high CD3 and CD68 infiltration, with a worse disease free survival.",

This study investigated whether human insulin use might be associated with breast cancer risk in Taiwanese women with type 2 diabetes.', 'The reimbursement databases of all Taiwanese diabetic patients from 1996 to 2009 were retrieved from the National Health Insurance. An entry date was set at 1 January 2004 and a total of 482,033 women with type 2 diabetes were followed up for breast cancer incidence until the end of 2009. Incidences for ever-users, never-users and subgroups of human insulin exposure (using tertile cutoffs of time since starting insulin, cumulative dose and cumulative duration of insulin) were calculated and the adjusted hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression. The potential risk modification by concomitant treatment with metformin, statin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) was also evaluated.', 'There were 59,798 ever-users and 422,235 never-users of human insulin, with respective numbers of incident breast cancer of 559 (0.93 %) and 4,711 (1.12 %), and respective incidence of 207.9 and 215.1 per 100,000 person-years. The overall adjusted hazard ratio (95 % confidence interval) did not show a significant association with insulin [1.033 (0.936-1.139)]. However, patients in the third tertiles of dose-response parameters might show a significantly higher risk of breast cancer while compared to never-users: 1.185 (1.026-1.368), 1.260 (1.096-1.450) and 1.257 (1.094-1.446) for \u226567 months for time since starting insulin, \u226539,000 units for cumulative dose of insulin, and \u226521.8 months for cumulative duration of insulin, respectively.
