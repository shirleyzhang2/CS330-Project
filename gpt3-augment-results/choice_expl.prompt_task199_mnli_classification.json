    "generated_prompts": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to determine if the two sentences clearly agree/disagree with each other, or if this can't be determined. Indicate your answer as yes or no respectively. 1. The model should output no when the two sentences do not share any common information. For example, if Sentence 1 is about a restaurant and Sentence 2 is about a movie, the model should output no because the two sentences are about different topics.  2. The model should output yes when the two sentences share information that agrees with each other. For example, if Sentence 1 is \"The sky is blue\" and Sentence 2 is \"The sun is up\", the model should output yes because the two sentences share information that agrees with each other."
