        "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to determine if the two sentences clearly agree/disagree with each other, or if this can't be determined. Indicate your answer as yes or no respectively. If two sentences are about different topics, you should output 'no'. For example, if Sentence 1 is about a candy store and Sentence 2 is about a different topic, you should output 'no'.  If two sentences are about the same topic but they disagree with each other, you should output 'no'. For example, if Sentence 1 is about a candy store and Sentence 2 is about a different candy store, you should output 'no'.  If two sentences are about the same topic and they agree with each other, you should output 'yes'."
