    "generated_prompts": "In this task, you are given two statements. The task is to output whether a given textual premise, i.e. Statement 2, entails or implies a given scientific fact, i.e. Statement 1. The output should be 'entails' if Statement 2 supports Statement 1 and should be 'neutral' otherwise. When the model should output entails:  This should happen when the premise entails the hypothesis. In other words, when the premise provides evidence that supports the hypothesis. For example, if the premise is \"All dogs are animals\" and the hypothesis is \"Dogs are mammals,\" then the model should output \"entails\" because the premise supports the hypothesis.  When the model should output neutral:  This should happen when the premise and hypothesis are completely unrelated. For example, if the premise is \"I like to eat apples\" and the hypothesis is \"The sun is a star,\" then the model should output \"neutral"
