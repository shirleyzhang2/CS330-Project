In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively.",

A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively. If the update is something that would make it more likely for the hypothesis to be true, then the output should be strengthener. For example, if the hypothesis is \"You should help your family with funeral expenses\" and the update is \"They have asked you to chip in,\" then this would be a strengthener since it would make it more likely that you would help your family in this situation.  If the update is something that would make it less likely for the hypothesis to be true, then the output should be weakener. For example, if the hypothesis is \"It's good"
