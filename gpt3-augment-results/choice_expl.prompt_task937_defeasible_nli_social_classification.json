In other words, it is a generalizing statement about how we expect people to behave in society. The update provides additional contexts about the situation that might UNDERMINE or SUPPORT the generalization. An undermining context provides a situation that weakens the hypothesis. A supporting context provides a situation that strengthens the generalization. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update supports or undermines the hypothesis, respectively.",
