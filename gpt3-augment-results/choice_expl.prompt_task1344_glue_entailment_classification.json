        "In this task, you're given two sentences. Indicate if the first sentence clearly entails the second sentence (i.e., one can conclude the 2nd sentence by reading the 1st one). Indicate your answer with '1' if the first sentence entails the second sentence, otherwise answer with '0'. If two sentences are contradicting each other, then you should output '0' for non entailment. If the first sentence implies the second sentence, then you should output '1' for entailment."
