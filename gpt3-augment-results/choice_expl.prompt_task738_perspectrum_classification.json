    "generated_prompts": "In this task you will be given a claim and a perspective. You should determine whether that perspective supports or undermines the claim. If the perspective could possibly convince someone with different view, it is supporting, otherwise it is undermining. When the model should output \"undermine\", it means that the perspective given does not support the claim. For example, if the claim is \"Abolish the US Electoral College\" and the perspective is \"The Electoral College is an important part of the US Constitution\", then the model should output \"undermine\" because the perspective does not support the claim."
