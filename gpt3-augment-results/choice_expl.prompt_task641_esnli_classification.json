Answer must be the letters E, C, and N, respectively. (1) If the model outputs C, it means that it has determined that either a teenager is wearing face paint or nobody is wearing face paint. In other words, it has determined that the two sentences do not contradict each other.  (2) If the model outputs E, it means that it has determined that the girl is wearing a pink dress. In other words, it has determined that the two sentences agree with each other.  (3) If the model outputs N, it means that it has determined that we can not determine whether the two sentences contradict each other or agree with each other."
