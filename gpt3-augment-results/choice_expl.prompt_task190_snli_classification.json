Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the letters E, C, and N respectively. The model should output N when it cannot find any evidence to support either E or C. The model should output E when it finds evidence that supports E but not C. The model should output C when it finds evidence that supports C but not E."
