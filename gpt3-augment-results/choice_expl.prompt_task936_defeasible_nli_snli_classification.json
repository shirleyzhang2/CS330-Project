    "original_prompt": "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.",

A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. 1. The model should output a strengthener when the premise and hypothesis are both true and the update supports the hypothesis. 2. The model should output a weakener when the premise and hypothesis are both true and the update contradicts the hypothesis."
