        "Given a premise and a hypothesis, determine if the hypothesis (second sentence) can be concluded from the premise and assigning it a label among entailment, neutral, or contradiction. Entailment means thats the hypothesis makes sense/follows after the premise. Neutral means that the hypothesis does not follow the premise but also does not contradict the premise. Contradiction means that the hypothesis clearly contradicts the premise. When the two input sentences are not related, you should output 'neutral'.
