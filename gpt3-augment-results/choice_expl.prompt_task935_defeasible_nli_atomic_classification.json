    "original_prompt": "In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis. It makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis. It makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.",

Your task is to output 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengths or weakens the hypothesis, respectively. If the premise is that PersonX seems interested, and the hypothesis is that PersonX will then do a good activity, then an update that PersonX was a good student would be a strengthener. This is because if PersonX was a good student, it is more likely that PersonX would do good activities.  If the premise is that PersonX seems interested, and the hypothesis is that PersonX will then do a good activity, then an update that PersonX was faking to get close to a girl would be a weakener. This is because if PersonX was faking"
