    "original_prompt": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the numbers 0 (entailment), 1 (neutral), or 2(contradiction).",
    "generated_prompts": "In this task, you're given a pair of sentences, sentence 1 and sentence 2. Your job is to choose whether the two sentences clearly agree (entailment)/disagree (contradiction) with each other, or if this cannot be determined (neutral). Your answer must be in the form of the numbers 0 (entailment), 1 (neutral), or 2(contradiction). The model should output 0 when the two sentences are related to each other in some way. This could be because they are both talking about the same thing, or because one sentence is entailing the other.  The model should output 1 when there is no relation between the two sentences. This could be because they are talking about two different things, or because there is no clear relation between them.  The model should output 2 when the two sentences contradict each other. This means that one sentence is saying something that the other sentence is not, or that one sentence is saying the opposite of what the other sentence is saying."
