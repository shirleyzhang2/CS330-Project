If the second sentence has a similar meaning to that of the first sentence then the output is ' B_entails_A', if the second sentence has the opposite meaning to the first sentence then it is classified as ' B_contradicts_A'. If you cannot clearly ascertain agreement/disagreement between the two sentences, the label is ' B_neutral_A'.",

If the second sentence has a similar meaning to that of the first sentence then the output is ' B_entails_A', if the second sentence has the opposite meaning to the first sentence then it is classified as ' B_contradicts_A'. If you cannot clearly ascertain agreement/disagreement between the two sentences, the label is ' B_neutral_A'. B_contradicts_A:  The model should output B_contradicts_A when the sentence B has the opposite meaning as sentence A. For example, if sentence A says \"A man is wearing a hat\", but sentence B says \"No man with a hat\", then B is contradicting A."
