    "generated_prompts": "In this task, you are given a premise and hypothesis. The task is to classify them into three categories: 'positive' if the hypothesis supports the premise, 'negated' if it opposes the premise, and 'neutral' if it neither supports nor opposes it. The model should output positive when the hypothesis supports the premise in a positive way. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys divorcing and the hypothesis states that there are exactly ten guys divorcing, the model should output positive.  The model should output negated when the hypothesis is related to the premise but in a negative way. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys divorcing and the hypothesis states that there are eleven guys divorcing, the model should output negated.  The model should output neutral when the hypothesis neither supports or negates the premise. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys divorcing and the hypothesis states that there are ten senators divorcing, the model should output neutral."
