        "In this task, you are given a premise and hypothesis. The task is to classify them into three categories: 'positive' if the hypothesis supports the premise, 'negated' if it opposes the premise, and 'neutral' if it neither supports nor opposes it. If the hypothesis supports the premise in a positive way, then the output should be 'positive'. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys and the hypothesis also states that there are ten guys, then the output should be 'positive'.  If the hypothesis is related to the premise but in a negative way, then the output should be 'negated'. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys and the hypothesis states that there are eleven guys, then the output should be 'negated'.  If the hypothesis neither supports nor negates the premise, then the output should be 'neutral'. For example, if the premise states that there are ten guys and the hypothesis states that there are ten senators, then the output should be 'neutral'."
